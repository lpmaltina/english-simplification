This news is about coffee. People in London drink a lot of coffee. People have to throw away around 200,000 tonnes of used coffee every year. However, they can still use the coffee grounds . One man has a factory. This factory takes out the oils from the coffee. It produces coffee logs . You can use these logs instead of wood. One log comes from the waste of 25 cups of coffee. The man’s factory produces 50,000 tonnes of logs a year. That is enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes!	Around 200,000 tonnes of used coffee end up in London’s landfills a year. A young man named Arthur Kay, however, knows how to make use of the coffee grounds . First, his factory takes out the oils from the used coffee grounds. The oils are basically biodiesel, which smells of coffee. The coffee grounds without the oils are then turned into little logs . You can use these logs instead of wood in your fireplace. 25 cups of coffee make one log. The coffee logs burn hotter and longer than wood. Key’s factory produces 50,000 tonnes of the logs a year. That is enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.	Around 200,000 tonnes of coffee  grounds end up in London’s landfills a year, but 26-year-old Arthur Kay, the CEO of Bio-Bean, has a solution. The Londoner has been developing his business for three years and has high profile supporters including Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, which controls more than 400 companies. Key explained that his business takes out the oils from the used coffee grounds, which could then be potentially used as a biodiesel, to create a coffee log product, which is a solid fuel for use in your fireplace at home. One log is from the waste of 25 cups of coffee, and the logs burn hotter and longer than wood, according to Mr Key. Every tonne of coffee used instead of coal saves the same amount of CO2 as driving a black cab from London to Beijing and back twice! Each year, Key’s factory produces 50,000 tonnes of product, which is enough to power several hundred thousand homes. If people got all of the used coffee grounds in the UK, they could probably power around two-thirds of London just from waste coffee grounds. Arthur was really excited in the beginning about coffee logs smelling like coffee, but says that it is actually a more or less odourless  fuel . However, the coffee oils smell very strongly of coffee.

And the country’s Interior Minister has blasted the police for failing to do their job. Whilst opposing sides of the refugee debate are being further polarised by incidents like this.

If they have kept such dangerous animals then they should keep a guard outside the enclosure.” Officials from the zoo said that Maqsood jumped inside the animal’s enclosure despite being warned against it by security guards.

Kentucky is a state in the USA. A police car is on a road there. A deer runs across the road. It hits the police car. The driver starts to  brake . The car does not change its course . This is safe. This is a good example to people. The deer damages the car, but the deer is OK. It runs away.	A deer in Kentucky ran into the road and hit a police car. The driver started to break , but he managed to keep control of the car. This incident serves as an example of what to do if you ever run into a deer. A camera inside the car filmed the incident. You can see that the deer did a triple axel in the air. It landed back on the ground and ran away. It seemed to be fine.	Dashcam  footage in a police vehicle shows a deer rushing into the road before the car hits it, and it dramatically flies through the air. The Kentucky, USA, officer applied the brakes, but he managed to keep the vehicle on course despite the collision. The local police department hopes that the encounter will be a lesson to everyone on what to do if you ever run into a deer. It said that although the police officer did not manage to avoid the collision, he did maintain control of his vehicle throughout the entire instant, even when the large, but apparently agile and acrobatically trained deer was performing a triple axel over the hood of his car. The police department even joked that, as it is getting closer to Christmas, it would have to check with Santa if he was not missing any helpers . The police car sustained a lot of damage from the incident, but remarkably, you can see the deer at the end of the video escaping seemingly uninjured.
In China, there is a goat farm. A farmer can see a baby monkey. The baby monkey makes friends with the goats. It rides on their backs. The baby monkey weighs three kilograms. The farmer films the baby monkey. He thinks that it feels safe with the goats. People want to send the monkey to a zoo. They want to return it back into nature later.	In a southern part of China, a herd of goats found an unlikely friend. The owner of a goat farm filmed a baby monkey riding on the backs of goats for several days. The owner said that the monkey weights around three kilograms. He also said that the monkey probably felt safe with the goats. People who help animals plan to send the monkey to the nearest zoo. They believe that the animal will be released into the wild later.	In a southern part of China, a herd of goats have found an unlikely friend. The owner of the goats filmed a baby monkey riding on various goats’s backs for several days. Based on the information from the owner of the goat farm, the monkey weights about three kilograms. He also told the reporters that it seemed like the monkey felt more safe with the goats. Local wildlife protection authorities plan to send the monkey to the nearest zoo. They believe that they will release the animal into the wild at a later date.
Here is some news from England. People see a jellyfish. It is very big. It looks like an alien . It is 20 kilograms heavy. This jellyfish is big, but it cannot hurt you. It only swims in the water. It eats plankton . People also see a different type of jellyfish. It called is the blue jellyfish. This jellyfish can hurt you a little.	People saw a huge jellyfish off the coast of England. It looks like something from a different world. It weighs 20 kilograms. It measures up to one metre in diameter . Despite the size, this type of jellyfish cannot hurt humans. It only swims up and down and looks for plankton to eat. People saw a large number of blue jellyfish also. Unlike the big cousin, this kind of jellfish can hurt you a little.	Described as a gentle  giant of the jellyfish world, this huge barrel jellyfish made an appearance in an estuary near St Mawes in Cornwall. Marine awareness officer Matt Slater and his dog Mango decided to swim out for a closer look and captured this incredible footage . The alien -looking creature weighs a whopping 20 kilos and is said to measure up to one metre in diameter. More barrel jellyfish are said to have started turning up around Cornwall and this is down to an increase in their food source. Despite their size, barrel jellyfish are harmless to humans, and are more aware of the water world than we think, constantly swimming up and down in the water looking for plankton. Matt has also reported sightings of compass and moon jellyfish in Cornish waters. Cornwall’s north coast has also seen huge numbers of blue jellyfish which, unlike barrel jellyfish, can give a mild sting.
The Niagara Falls is a popular attraction for tourists. It is a group of three waterfalls between Canada and the US. They are more than 50 meters high. The falls freeze in December. People can see thick ice on the top of the falls. It seems that the water does not move. It is not possible. The river is very strong. There is so much water that it can never freeze. Water still flows under the ice. The falls freeze only once. Ice from Lake Eerie stops the river and it freezes. It cannot happen today. A special steel construction stops the ice. It does not get in the river.	In February, cold winds brought very low temperatures to North America. The Niagara Falls, which are one of the best tourist attractions in the US, froze. The falls did not freeze completely , but they looked so. Thick ice made a crust on the falls, but the water was still flowing under the ice. The falls cannot freeze because there is too much water in them, and the water is very strong. It can never stop flowing. The water stopped flowing only once in history. It happened when ice from Lake Eerie blocked the flow, so only little water was flowing in the falls. It cannot happen again because there is a special construction on the river which stops the ice.	As temperatures plunged across North America in February, the Niagara Falls partially froze on both sides of the US-Canada border. Thick ice formations coated the iconic waterfall; however, the amount of ice didn´t stop the water from flowing completely. The volume and force of the water is too great to ever freeze solid, even at extremely low temperatures. The sheets of ice make it appear as though the falls have stopped; however, the water continues to flow underneath. The Niagara Falls have only stopped flowing once in history due to ice from Lake Eerie that clogged the mouth of the river. In the 1960s, steel ice booms were installed upriver to prevent that from happening again.

Lake Dojran is in North Macedonia and Greece. It is the third largest lake in Macedonia. It has an area of 43 km 2 . It is 10 meters deep. Farmers use the water for their fields and animals in the 1990s. Farmers use up almost all the water from the lake. There are no fish. Fishermen do not have work. Tourists do not come. North Macedonia and Greece want to solve the problem. They fill the lake. They use water from the ground. Fish return to the lake. Fishermen are happy. Scientists say that the water is dirty. There are many problems. It seems though that the situation will get better.	Lake Dojran is in North Macedona and Greece. It has an area of 43 km 2 , and it is 10 meters deep. In the 1990s, farmers used the water from Lake Dojran, and the lake almost disappeared . There were no fish and fishermen lost work. The impact on tourism was strong, too. Both countries decided to save the lake and North Macedonia pumped underground water to fill the lake. In recent years, it rained a lot, which helped increase the level of water, too. Now, fishermen say that there are more fish in the lake than before. Scientists say that there is still not enough water and that the lake is dirty, and it has an impact on animals and plants living there. Fishermen are happy though and they believe that there will be more good news in the future.	North Macedonia´s fishermen say that the future of Lake Dojran looks brighter with rising water levels and increasing number of fish. The lake has an area of 43 km 2 and it is shared between North Macedonia and Greece. Due to the overuse of the lake´s water for agricultural purposes, this Balkan lake almost disappeared when it lost two thirds of its water in the 1990s, and local fisheries and tourism nearly collapsed. To reverse the decline, the countries took measures to replenish and sustain the lake´s water levels. North Macedonia began pumping water from underground sources, and frequent and heavy rainfalls in the last years also helped restore the lake´s water levels. Local fishermen say that there are now more fish in the lake; however, scientists say that people still face the consequences of the flora and fauna in the lake. There are sources of pollution that affect the water quality, and the level of water still isn´t properly regulated.

He has dementia . Police decide to stop his car. They stop it by hitting it with their car. The manoeuvre is a  success . The car stops. The old man is not injured. One policeman is injured a little.	A car was going the wrong way on a motorway in England. A 77-year-old man drove the car. He has dementia. The car was a great danger and police had to do something to stop it. They decided to hit the car with their police car. The manoeuvre was a success and the car stopped. The driver of the car was uninjured. One police officer was injured a little.	“He’s going to hit! He’s going to hit! He’s going to hit us. We had to, mate . I know you did, I know you did.” Brave West Midlands police officers prevented a serious collision by deliberately crashing into a car going the wrong way down the motorway. Officers from the Force Traffic Unit and the Central Motorway Police Group were sent to the M6 at around 9.50pm where they located the Honda Jazz heading south on the northbound carriageway in the Sutton-Coldfield area. The vehicle was travelling at around 50 mph (80 kph), and officers took the decision to make deliberate contact with the side of the Honda to bring it to a stop. “We’re about to take this car out. The vehicle is stopped. Our vehicle is slightly damaged, unfortunately. He was coming too fast towards us. We’ve got vehicles lane three in the oncoming.” The manoeuvre was a success, and the vehicle was stopped. The driver of the car was uninjured, while one of the officers suffered a minor injury. A rolling roadblock was in place to safeguard other motorists on the road during the collision. The driver was found to be a 77-year-old man who had dementia and had been reported missing from his home just hours earlier. He was checked over by paramedics at the scene and then returned home to his family.

Er Shun and her zoo partner Da Mao are on loan from China for 10 years as part of a long-term breeding program.
Daniel Craig is an actor. He is famous. He plays James Bond. He is also a UN advocate . Daniel Craig visits Cyprus. Cyprus is split into two parts. One part is Turkish. The second part is Greek. There are bombs on the border . People destroy the bombs. Daniel Craig helps with this.	Daniel Craig is an actor famous for playing James Bond. He is also a UN advocate . He visited Cyprus for two days. In 1974 Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion after Greek Cypriots tried to unite Cyprus with Greece. Daniel Craig helped with destroying landmines on the 184-kilometre line which splits the land between Turkey and Greece.	In true James Bond style, actor Daniel Craig dropped into Cyprus via helicopter, but he wasn’t there on a 007 mission. His visit was part of his role as a UN global advocate . “It’s been an extraordinary experience because I’ve been able to get close to the people working on the ground in mine fields and de-miners.” Craig spent two days on the island, offering a helping hand in de-mining landmines and explosives on the 115-mile ceasefire line splitting the land. “I was given the chance to blow up a couple of anti-tank mines, which I’m used to being near explosions, I suppose, but nothing like this and you really understand when you hear these things go off . Not just the amount of damage that they can potentially do but the sort of terror it strikes into people that are anywhere near them, when they’re just sitting there silently just waiting for a target.” Over the last decade United Nations de-miners have removed over 27,000 landmines from the U.N. buffer zone in Cyprus. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief  coup by militant Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

24.8 million Americans play golf in 2020. It is 500,000 more than in 2019. Golf becomes very popular in 2020. It is interesting because the coronavirus also starts in 2020. People cannot leave their homes. Golf clubs are not sure what will happen. They worry the people will stop playing golf. It does not happen. Golf is a sport for more than business people. Young people start to play golf. They think that golf is cool . There are new technologies and apps. Players can see their progress in their phones.	In 2020, there were 24.8 million golfers in the US, which was 500,000 more than in 2019. It was the largest increase in 17 years. When the coronavirus pandemic started in 2020, golf clubs worried about their future. They thought that people would stop playing golf. Then the opposite happened, and golf became more popular than ever before. One of the reasons was the pandemic, and another reason was that people probably started to look at the sport differently. Golf was more than a sport only for business people. It became cool for young people and for people from different backgrounds . There are new technologies and apps which make the game more interesting and friendly for more people. Currently, there are around 80 million golfers in the world. 50 to 60 million are playing to get better, and these technologies help them follow their progress .	While most sports struggled to survive the pandemic, golf thrived , becoming more popular than it had been in decades. As the pandemic began in 2020, people needed some way to get out of the house. In 2020, the world shut down, and golf associations were concerned about solvency and if people would play golf again. However, there has been a resurgence . Last year, there were 24.8 million golfers in the US, an increase of about 500,000 or 2% over 2019, which was the largest increase in 17 years. The pandemic may be a part of it; however, companies and technologies are also playing a role. There are changes to the game itself. Everybody is welcome to play, the sport is becoming cooler, and there are technologies both on and off the course that make the game more accessible.
Mega means very big. Megaships are very big ships. They carry things from one part of the world to another. They carry everything like fresh food, electronics, furniture, or other things. A megaship gets stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021. It cannot move. It stays there for six days. Other ships must wait. People do not get things in time. Megaships carry thousands of tons of goods . The ships are getting bigger and bigger. It makes transport cheaper. It brings many problems, too. Bigger ships need more space. They go slower. Sometimes they lose their things in the ocean. Pirates can also attack them more easily.	In March 2021, the Ever Given megaship was stuck in the Suez Canal for six days. Almost 200,000 tons of cargo were on the ship, which meant that people could not get things like IKEA furniture, fruit and vegetables, or electronics in time. After the accident, people finally saw how big these ships were. Megaships very quickly increase the number of things which they can carry. The number doubles every few years, and transportation companies do it because it makes transport cheaper. It brings more problems, too. Bigger ships need deeper water, larger equipment, and more space in docks . These ships go slower which means that customers wait longer for things. When the weather is bad, megaships have bigger problems at sea. It happens more and more often that such big ships lose their cargo in sea. Since they go slower, pirates also attack them more often.	When the Ever Given became stuck in the Suez Canal in March 2021, holding up nearly 200,000 tons of cargo from fresh fruits and vegetables to IKEA furniture, people realized the huge size of these megaships. Megaships that now dominate container shipping have been growing in size for more than 50 years, and even doubling in capacity every few years since the 2000s. The bigger they grow, the more containers they carry, and the cheaper the transportation costs for each container. However, they cause problems for consumers and producers, too. Megaships need places to dock, deeper water channels, stronger quay walls, and larger equipment. These are expensive adaptations for many ports that are publicly owned. Another problem is the increased risk to the goods that megaships carry because they go slower than other ships. The losses of cargo are increasing every year, and on top of that, megaships are also a bigger target for piracy and cybercrime .
Scientists find a new coronavirus variant . It comes from South Africa. This is bad news. The new variant is very different from the original virus. Medications stop the original virus. Scientists do not know if they stop the new virus, too. Scientists must learn quickly. Four countries have the new variant. These countries are Israel, Botswana, Hong Kong, and Belgium. Some countries already ban travel from South Africa and five other African countries. The EU says that it is important to stop travel to South Africa. It can stop the new variant. Then it cannot get to Europe.	In South Africa, scientists detected a new coronavirus variant . The news worried scientists and world leaders because the variant was very different from the original virus. The new variant had many changes in its protein , and scientists did not know yet if the vaccines work against it. Some countries already stopped travel from South Africa and five other African countries. Four countries already reported cases of the new variant. They were Israel, Botswana, Hong Kong, and Belgium. The President of the EU Commission said that European leaders had to do something very quickly. She said that it was important to stop travel to some African countries, because it could stop the movement of the new variant.	Authorities around the world reacted with alarm to a new coronavirus variant detected in South Africa, as researchers worked to establish if the mutation can resist vaccines. On Friday, the last passengers arrived at London´s Heathrow Airport from South Africa after Britain and other countries stopped flights from there and five neighboring countries. The new coronavirus variant alarmed scientists and world leaders because it has a spike protein that is dramatically different from the original virus that the vaccines are based on. Belgium reported the first known case in Europe, adding to those in Israel, Botswana, and Hong Kong. The World Health Organization cautioned against hasty travel bans; however, the European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU should act very swiftly, decisively, and as one. She added that all air travel to South African countries should be stopped to limit the movement of the new variant.
American viewers like digital streaming more and more. They do not enjoy cable or satellite TV as much as in the past. The money that companies get from streaming is the highest in history. People   pay regularly every month to get Netflix. In the past, Netflix must do a lot of  hard work to change the thinking of people. People start cancelling cable and satellite TV.  They want Netflix instead. There are new companies which want to make business in streaming. Disney is the biggest company. It  already has a very good position . Experts say that Disney is very clever. Disney does not need to work hard but waits for the best moment to start the business.	Digital streaming is becoming more and more popular with Americans. Reports say that last year, people paid $16.3 billion more for digital streaming services than in the previous year. Companies like HBO or Netflix convinced people to cancel cable or satelite TV and pay for streaming videos. Currently, more people pay for Netflix than cable or satelite TV. Now, there are new players on the scene, with Disney and Apple. Disney is already one of the biggest companies in the streaming business. Experts say that Netflix did the hard work and prepared the ideal situation for other companies, that know how to benefit from them.	For the first time ever, more Americans pay for digital streaming than cable or satellite TV. Reports say that in 2018 income for digital streaming services increased to $16.3 billion. In the US, there are more Netflix subscriptions than there are cable TV subscriptions. In the past, platforms like HBO Now or Netflix needed to convince the American public to cancel cable or satelite TV and pay for streaming videos. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus are newcomers to the streaming industry; however, Disney Plus is one of the biggest competitors of the streaming industry ever. Experts say that this is because Netflix paved the way for the other competitors and Disney seized this opportunity .
Peat is a dark brown thing. It looks like dirt. It contains dead plants, vegetables, and other things. Farmers often use it to grow plants. Scientists in Estonia use peat for something different. They make batteries from it. They heat the peat for a few hours. They get a brown powder. They use the powder for a new type of batteries. These batteries are called sodium-ion batteries. Most electric things use lithium-ion batteries. People can charge them many times. They cost more money. Expensive metals are in lithium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are cheaper. Scientists believe that they are not so bad for the natural world.	Scientists in Estonia found a new way to make sodium-ion batteries . They used peat , which was cheaper then some metals in batteries, like lithium or cobalt. Currently, people use lithium-ion batteries most often, but the problem with these batteries is that they are more expensive and harmful to the environment. The scientists heat the peat to a high temperature for two to three hours. Then they get a carbon powder which they use for the batteries. The technology is new, and nobody really knows yet how good it will be. Still, the world is looking for technologies that are better for the environment, and with electric cars, car makers will need more and more batteries. This technology could help solve the problem with batteries in the future.	Scientists in Estonia’s Tartu University say that they found a way to use peat in sodium-ion batteries. The peat lowers the overall cost; however, the technology is still very new. Sodium-ion batteries are one of the new technologies that battery makers are studying as they seek alternatives to the popular lithium-ion model. Sodium-ion batteries aren’t so costly because they don’t contain lithium, cobalt, or nickel. The peat in the batteries is very cheap as it’s not used for agriculture or fuel; however, it yields a good quality carbon powder for batteries as well as super capacitors. The process includes heating peat to a high temperature in a furnace for two to three hours. The carbon is then used to make parts for the batteries. With an increasing move worldwide to renewable energy and electric vehicles, alternatives like this could be very important.

Yet China, she claimed , needed the bridge as a political symbol to remind Hongkongers that they are connected to the motherland .
People are building a skyscraper . It is called the Shanghai Tower . It is in Shanghai, China. It has 120 floors. It is 632 metres tall. It is the tallest building in China, but it is not the tallest building in the world. It is the second tallest building. Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world. Burj Khalifa is in Dubai, Saudi Arabia. It is 200 metres taller than the Shanghai Tower.	People are building China’s tallest building. Its name is the Shanghai Tower and they will finish it this summer. With 120 floors, it will be 632 metres tall. It won’t be the world’s tallest building – it will be 200 metres lower than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. However, a chief architect explained that this is not a bad thing. He says that when a building which is the tallest in the world is built, there is a recession . There was a recession when the Empire State Building was built. For the first ten years, it didn’t make any money! But now, it is one of the most successfully rented buildings. It is iconic , people know it and people want to be in it. Shanghai Tower will house mainly financial institutions and government agencies.	The Shanghai Tower is set to be the world’s second tallest building when it’s completed in the summer. The 120 floors of the 632-metre structure will make the building the tallest in China but bringing it just under 200 metres lower than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. “So, when Sears Tower was built, there was a recession . When the Petronas Towers were built, there was a recession. When the Burj Khalifa was built, there was a recession. This is not the world’s tallest building so there’s no recession. So, that’s the world’s tallest building curse , not the skyscraper curse. So, it’s actually better to be number two than number one. I think one of the most profitable skyscrapers in the world is the Empire State Building. But for the first 10 years, it didn’t make any money because it was opening during a recession. I think that goes back to the skyscraper—the world’s tallest building curse. There was a recession right after that. But now, it’s one of the most successfully rented buildings in the world because it’s iconic, people know it and people want to be in it.” The Shanghai Tower is set to house mainly financial institutions and government agencies.

Some people want same-sex marriage to be legal . In Ireland, people vote about same-sex marriage. Some people think that it will be hard to pass the law. But they are wrong.

People do not always agree on ideas. But Ireland passed same-sex marriage by popular vote.	In Ireland, politicians campaigned to make same-sex marriage legal.

One man at a voting area said that he was proud to be Irish and that today his people showed what they believe in. He said that people told many stories about this event already. Ireland is the first country in the world to pass same-sex marriage by popular vote , which means that most of its people supported the law.	It was the culmination of a long and sometimes challenging campaign for supporters of same-sex marriage in Ireland. Soon after the ballot boxes were open this morning, it became clear that Ireland had backed the changed. “I think we’re looking at two-to-one yes vote. I think that a couple of months ago, we would have taken that very small yes vote, a very small margin of victory, but now it looks like there’s been a resounding ‘yes’ across the country. I’m just so proud to be Irish today. It’s been an emotional journey for many people that have been campaigning on this. A huge amount of personal stories have been told in rooms and halls around the country and on the airwaves , and I don’t think Ireland’s ever going to go back after this. We’ve made a resounding statement about what we believe in.” Irish voters rejected another proposal to lower the minimum age of presidential candidates from 35 to 21. But that result is likely to be forgotten with time, as Ireland goes down in history as the first country in the world to introduce same-sex marriage by popular  vote .

Traveling during COVID-19 is different. People fly again. They follow new rules. US officials say that passengers now are more aggressive . Passengers must agree that they will wear masks during a flight. They do not always want to do it. They are angry. They attack a flight attendants . Flight attendants get special training to know what to do when a passenger is angry. There are many events when something bad happens. A passenger can pay money of up to 37,000 dollars if he does not follow the rules or is aggressive.	A US organization for flights said that there were more incidents on planes when passengers did not want to follow rules, and they even attacked flight attendants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traveling changed, and since January, the number of incidents on US planes went up a lot. Most of the incidents had to do with wearing masks. Passengers must agree that they will wear masks during a flight, but they do not always want to do it. They are angry, and they attack the workers. Flight attendants can take a special training where they learn how to deal with such passengers. The organization said that it would not tolerate any attacks on flight attendants, and anyone who threaten or attack them, could get a fine of up to 37,000 dollars.	As of 28 September, the US Federal Aviation Administration documented nearly 4,500 reports of unruly passengers and close to 3,300 mask-related incidents. Airline passengers who behave badly is nothing new; however, in January, due to a disturbing increase in violent behavior on flights, the FAA enacted a no-tolerance policy for anyone who assaults, threatens or interferes with airline crew members. Travel after the pandemic is not the same, and rules like wearing a mask must be enforced on flights by federal law. However, this has been a real challenge for crew members. Although passengers sign an agreement that they will wear the masks, they don´t always want to do it. As flight attendants have been attacked, they´re currently being taught effective self-defense for use on board. Consequences for unruly behavior have been upped with a fine of up to 37,000 dollars or criminal charges. The FAA already started 169 cases this year and levied more than 1 million dollars in fines.
Many people in Nigeria have the coronavirus. It brings problems for hospitals. They do not have enough oxygen . People need oxygen to live. Oxygen is in the air that people breathe . COVID-19 patients sometimes need oxygen from a tank . They have problems if they try to breathe alone. Many people become sick in Autumn or Fall. Hospitals do not have oxygen for so many people. Factories which make oxygen must make more of it. Officials decide to build two new factories. They want to make even more factories in the future. It is difficult to know how much oxygen will hospitals need. Some patients are very sick. They need a lot of oxygen. Some patients do not need oxygen at all.	A second wave of the coronavirus hit Nigeria and it brought problems with oxygen for COVID-19 patients. Hospitals reported more than 65,000 sick people since Autumn or Fall last year and they needed seven times more oxygen than before. In November, factories which produced oxygen started to have problems because the number of patients grew very quickly. Officials decided to build two new factories and they plan to build even more. Some COVID-19 patients need a lot of oxygen because they have big problems with their breathing. Some patients do not need so much oxygen, and it is the reason why it is not easy to know how much oxygen hospitals will need.	A second wave of coronavirus infections in Nigeria has caused nationwide oxygen shortages . The ability to help people breathe is under threat in Nigeria with hospitals coming close to running out. In Lagos State, the demand has increased seven-fold since early autumn and more than a half of over 130,000 confirmed cases have been reported in the past three months. According to the Lagos health commissioner, there has been a global scarcity of oxygen. Authorities have been getting the oxygen from their usual suppliers; however, the amount of oxygen needed depends on how many COVID-19 patients need a very high level of oxygen and how many patients are in intensive care. In November, oxygen plants struggled as demand soared and more plants had to start working at full capacity. Lagos has launched a new oxygen plant and the state plans to build two more.
This news is from England. There is an artist there. His name is Banksy. He makes street art . Some people like his art. Some people do not like it. Banksy paints a picture on the wall of a school. It is 14 feet long. It shows a child. The child runs after a burning  tyre . He also writes a letter. He says thank you to the students who named a part of the school after him.

The teachers are not going to allow the students to paint on the wall, but they are going to preserve and protect the artwork.	The appearance of a 14-foot mural on the side of a classroom would be met with disapproval in many schools. But not in Bristol’s Bridge Farm Primary and certainly not when that mural is the work of one of Britain’s most famous modern artists. This original Banksy was discovered by staff here early this morning, alongside a letter written by the secretive street artist himself. In it, he thanked students for naming a house after him and invited children to add to his work, writing, “I’m sure the teachers won’t mind”. But they probably would and plans are already afoot to preserve and protect the piece. “Well, we were going to paint over that over the summer holidays, so this will not be getting painted now, I’m afraid!” The mural shows a child with a stick chasing a burning tyre and although its meaning will likely be picked apart by the art world, the most important critics were very impressed . “I think it’s amazing.” “Really creative.” A spokesperson for Banksy has confirmed the artwork is genuine and the piece is already proving to be an inspiration for the children of Bridge Farm Primary.

He is at a press conference with the French President Francois Hollande. Putin says that Turkey should investigate this.	Vladimir Putin said that people are transporting oil from the Islamic State to Turkey. The pilots of Russian jets , which are operating in Syria, saw this. In a press conference held with the French President Francois Hollande, the Russian President urged Turkey to investigate the situation.

Many infectious diseases exist. It is not easy to control infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus. It is important to reach herd immunity. Herd immunity is the situation when most people are immune to a disease. However, it is not easy to reach the herd immunity. One way is to make a vaccine . However, it takes a long time to make a vaccine. It takes a long time to give it to all people. Another way is mass infection. Mass infection means that many people in a population get the disease. It can make problems for hospitals. Many people can get sick at the same time. The situation with the coronavirus is not easy. Scientists must make a vaccine. At the same time, people must follow strict rules. The rules help stop how many people get sick. Without the herd immunity, the coronavirus continues to exist.	Herd immunity is the situation when the majority of people become immune to a disease. Usually, 70-90% of people need to be immune to get herd immunity. However, it is not easy to get it because some diseases are more infectious than others. There are two ways to get herd immunity: a vaccine or a mass infection . To vaccinate enough people can take years. On the other hand, if too many people get sick at the same time, it can be a problem for hospitals. Experts say that the best way is to make a vaccine. Before the vaccine is ready, people should follow governments´ rules to help stop the spread of the disease. It is clear that the coronavirus will continue to exist, and without the herd immunity, more people could get sick again.	Herd immunity is the situation when majority of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease. Depending on how contagious the virus is, this usually means that 70-90% of people need to be immune to achieve herd immunity. Typically, this is done through a vaccine or a mass infection . It can take months or even years to vaccinate 90% of a population. On the other hand, mass infection could overwhelm hospitals and result in more deaths. According to some experts, the best way to achieve herd immunity is to continue social distancing measures until a vaccine is developed. Without a vaccine, lower infection rates and greater access to testing, herd immunity may never be achieved. Experts say that the coronavirus is here to live with us, and without increasing the herd immunity, it will eventually spread again.

This news is about Bewick’s swans. These swans migrate every year. They fly from the Russian Arctic to Britain. This is 7,242 kilometres across 11 countries. There are fewer swans now than in the past. People shoot the swans. Sometimes, the swans hit power lines. However, these threats are not so bad. There must be something else. One woman wants to find out. She flies a paramotor with the swans.	Bewick’s swans migrate from the Russian Arctic to Britain every year. They travel 7,242 kilometres over 11 countries. There is about a half of the swans than 20 years ago, but nobody knows exactly why. We know that people shoot the swans and that sometimes they hit power lines, but these threats are not as bad as to cause the death of so many birds. There has to be something else, or another piece of the puzzle. One conservationist wants to find out, so she is going to fly a paramotor with the swans. This is no small feat , especially because there are no roads for the first 1,609 kilometres – no one will be able to assist her.	Meet the high-flying conservationist hot on the trail of some disappearing birds. Sasha Dench is gearing up for a 4,500-mile (7,242 kilometres) flight from the Russian Arctic to Britain with a giant fan strapped to her back. “These are the risers , this is what I’m hanging off from in-flight, how I’m connected to the wing. I’ve got my brakes here, which I can pull down to steer, and for my accelerator, it’s basically just this strap here, so as you release that, I basically then make the wing fall faster and so I get about another 30, 35 kilometres an hour just by releasing those straps.” The journey is one made every year by thousands of Bewick’s swans and it’s their migratory flight that Sasha hopes to observe. Their numbers have halved in the past 20 years but nobody knows exactly why. “We know quite a few of the threats that they face from illegal shooting, ingesting lead shot which they get blood poisoning from, hitting power lines – that’s another big problem, but what we also know is that none of those threats on their own is bad enough to be causing the decline as it is, so there might be another piece of the puzzle that we’re missing. What we do know is that a load of the birds won’t survive migration this year.” The route will take Sasha over 11 countries and with no roads below her for the first 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometres) there will be no ground crew to assist her. It’s no small feat for a woman who just five years ago was terrified of flying. Sasha is set to take to the skies in the name of science next week.

An expat is someone who lives in another country than his own. Many expats live in Singapore. They rent apartments. Their situation changes during the coronavirus. Expats worry about work. They do not have enough money to live. They start to live together. They rent a room. They share a kitchen. This is called co-living. People rent a room for only a few months. It is better than renting an apartment. Now co-living is becoming more popular in Singapore. It is interesting that co-living starts during the coronavirus. The government has a good plan on how to stop the coronavirus. People are not afraid to live together.	The coronavirus made things more difficult for expats in Singapore. They started to worry about their work, and sometimes, they did not have enough money to rent an apartment. They found a solution called co-living. Co-living is when residents rent a room, and they share a kitchen or other rooms. It is a good way to save money, and some people like it also because they do not need to rent a room for the full year. Co-living is not the most popular way of living, but business operators say that the number of people who look for co-living, is growing. The interesting fact is that people started to look for co-living during the coronavirus pandemic. Operators explained that in Singapore, the government works hard to stop the virus, and people are not afraid to live together.	Uncertain work projects, anti-foreigner feelings and closed borders made co-living spaces increasingly attractive among expats in Singapore. Co-living is where you rent a room and share communal space like a kitchen. It has two main advantages. Firstly, it´s cheaper than renting a condo . Secondly, leases start from three months compared to a minimum full year for a condo. This is very appealing for those worried about job security or uncertain how much longer they plan to stay. While co-living is still a minority choice, and it isn´t going to take over condos for popularity, some business operators say that demand rose by at least 10%, and it is becoming a more accepted option. It may sound strange that demand for co-living rose during the coronavirus outbreak; however, in Singapore, the virus is largely under control, so residents don´t worry about living together.

Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are among the most affected countries. The insects are roughly the length of a finger, and a single swarm can measure 60 kilometers long to 40 kilometers wide. It can contain up to 150 million locusts per square kilometer, and an adult locust can eat its entire body weight every day. In a day, a swarm can destroy crops that could feed 2,500 people. The insects are causing enormous crop damage and are seriously threatening livelihood and food security in the area. In Kenya, there are disagreements over how to deal with the invasion. A Ministry of Agriculture official said that it is impractically impossible to control billions of insects by spraying chemicals on them. However, the Ministry of Agriculture Secretary said that the government is in control of the situation.

Rescue teams started scouring wreckage of the crashed plane for the black boxes. The head of rescue efforts said that the focus will be on finding the bodies of the victims and that chances of finding survivors were fading. Two years ago, Indonesia saw another deadly crash when a faulty Boeing 737 MAX killed all passengers and crew on board.

The Great Barrier Reef is 1,931 kilometres long. It is in Australia. It is the biggest living ecosystem . It is in danger. This year is very hot. The water is getting hot, too. This is not good for the coral . The coral dies when the water is too hot. The coral turns white. There is no life in it. It is just rock. This is called “bleaching”. People fly from Australia to Papua New Guinea. They film 500 coral reefs. 95% of them are white and yellow.	The Great Barrier Reef is 1,931 kilometres long, and it is along Australia’s northeast coast . It is the world’s largest living ecosystem and it is in danger. This year is very hot, partly because of the current El Niño climate cycle. The water temperature is rising which is very bad for corals. The coral is under stress and is driving out the living algae . Only the coral’s “rock” stays behind. Then the coral is dead. This is called bleaching. The Great Barrier Reef is being bleached. People filmed 500 coral reefs from the north of Australia to Papua New Guinea, and the video showed that 95% of them are white and yellow.	These aerials of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef are evidence the most untouched part of it has the most severe bleaching in its history. The footage , which filmed over 500 coral reefs during six days from Cairns to Papua New Guinea, shows 95% is white and yellow. Scientists say the bleaching happens in rising water temperatures – the coral, under stress, drives out living algae , causing it to calcify , and part of that is down to the current El Niño climate cycle. They say unless the World Heritage Site gets a break in the weather conditions within weeks, some coral areas are unlikely to survive. But the World Meteorological Organisation says a break in temperatures is unlikely, as this year looks set to be the hottest on record. The Great Barrier Reef stretches 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometres) along Australia’s northeast coast and is the world’s largest living ecosystem. Last May, the World Heritage Committee stopped short of placing it on an “in danger” list but this latest find may raise long-term concerns about its future.

Soon Apple will offer this service. The companies can pay up to $20,000 for the service.	Facebook began to offer quite a special service to its women employees. The women can have their eggs frozen so they can work for the company when they’re young and have children later in life. Apple will follow suit in January 2015. The companies will pay up to $20,000 for the procedure and storage of the female eggs. Some people say that the companies should offer more flexibility and help for new parents instead.	Tech giants Apple and Facebook are offering to help women employees put off pregnancy later in life by having their eggs frozen. Facebook has been offering the service for its employees in the US since the start of this year and Apple will follow suit from January 2015. Apple will pay both full and part time employees up to $20,000, that’s around £12,500 for the procedure, and storage costs for female eggs. The company said in a statement they want to empower their female employees to do the best work of their lives, as they care for loved ones and raise families. And fertility doctors agree this is the right thing to do. “So egg freezing offers the opportunity to delay fertility until later in life and benefit from a younger egg. They learn about their fertility. I think that’s one of the most important benefits. Even just talking to the doctor about it probably allows them to understand their fertility better. It’s not dangerous, it doesn’t affect future fertility, but the cost is high. So, if one lowers or eliminates that one barrier , I think we have a very positive track forward.” But others have suggested the companies should instead focus on offering more flexibility and support for new parents.

Wild bears in Japan started to come closer to towns and villages. Between April and September, there were more than 13,500 wild bear sightings , which was the highest number in the last five years. Scientists said that there were more reasons why bears came closer to people. This year was hard for bears because there was not enough food for them. Also, older people did not have enough energy to pick fruit in their gardens, and this fruit was very attractive for bears. The coronavirus could be one more reason because people did not spend so much time outside, and it was a good chance for the bears to walk in empty streets and gardens and look for some food. Some companies try to find a way to keep the bears away. One company made a special machine that looked like a wolf. It roared loudly and moved its head like a real wolf.	A record 13,500 wild bear sightings have been reported in Japan during the coronavirus pandemic which is the highest number of sightings in the last five years. According to scientists, there are several factors behind this. This year has been bad for acorns , the main food for bears, and the lack of food drove the bears closer to civilization. Besides this, aging residents are unable to harvest crops and fruits grown in their gardens, which tempts starving wild animals. The coronavirus may have also affected the bears´ behavior, as people are encouraged to stay home. Some companies are seeking solutions to keep bears away from residential areas and one of the ideas is a mechanical monster wolf which emits 90- decibel roars, and it moves its neck just like the bears´ predator.

Some people did not believe that Zhao would make a film about China because the country checks films and books. Artists are not free to do what they want. Many Chinese celebrated when Zhao won, and they said that she was very talented .	Chloe Zhao, the Beijing-born director who now resides in the US, has become the first Asian woman to win a Golden Globe for best director. The 38-year-old ´Nomadland´ director is only the second woman to win the award in that category with Barbra Streisand being the first in 1984. Many people praised Zhao online for being a huge inspiration for young Asian girls, and they added that it was a win for women everywhere. The semi-fictional ‘Nomadland’, which also got awarded for best drama, tells a story of a woman named Fern who travels around America as a modern-day nomad . Many people expressed regret that Zhao would probably never make such a powerful film about China given the country´s censorship environment. Her win was also celebrated on Chinese social media Weibo, where many praised her talent.

Washington is concerned that Moscow is more interested in propping up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad than beating Islamic State.
The World Health Organisation has some news. It says that processed meat gives you cancer . If you eat 50 grams of processed meat, there is an 18% chance that you will get cancer.

Experts found that eating 50 grams of processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18 per cent. Fifty grams is less than two slices of bacon. The organisation also found that red meat is probably carcinogenic , too. It tells people to re-think eating meat. While some people may stop eating meat, others do not believe this.	If you fancy sinking your teeth into a bacon butty , you may want to think again. The World Health Organisation has announced that processed meat, such as bacon, ham and sausages, can cause cancer. Experts found eating 50 grams of processed meat – that’s less than two slices of bacon – increases the risk of bowel cancer by 18%. Nutritionists are urging meat eaters to take  heed of the new advice. “Red and processed meat is linked to cancer with scientific evidence, so it’s not just something that has been suggested or that one report has said. So I would say that absolutely is something that we want to pay attention to, we want to take note .” The WHO report listed processed meat alongside alcohol, asbestos , arsenic and cigarettes as cancer-causing substances. It also classified red meat as “probably” carcinogenic, though there was limited evidence. But for many, the new guidelines won’t stop them from tucking into something meaty. “I mean, it’s ridiculous to compare red meat with cigarettes and things like that. It’s just ridiculous.” “I think food awareness in general is really important, but that’s possibly a step too far. I mean, every week, you know, tomatoes give you cancer, you know… There’s a new fad , a new alert… ” “We’ve been eating meat for years, and I don’t think it’s carcinogenic, so… But I think people are wise enough to read and make their own choices.”
A lot of people have smartphones. Some people spend too much time on their phones. This may be a bad thing. Some people use their phones for up to five hours a day.

Hackers are people who get into people´s computers. They steal important information. They often work in groups. A group of hackers get into 150,000 cameras in hospitals, schools, and other buildings in March. Experts say that the problem is that people use bad passwords . People use simple words or numbers. Sometimes, they say them to colleagues or friends. Hackers can get through bad passwords very quickly. There is a way to stop this problem. Some websites send you a text to your phone. You must confirm who you are. This is much safer. Also, when you choose a password, use letters, numbers and special symbols. It is not good to use a word which you can say easily.	In March, a group of hackers breached 150,000 security cameras inside hospitals, schools, prisons, and other buildings. Questions arose about why people used such bad passwords. Many people use simple passwords like ´password´, ´password1,´ or ´ABC123´ because they can easily remember them. Then hackers can guess such passwords without problems, and they can use people´s email addresses and usernames on websites and apps. Bad passwords are the main reason why employees must change their passwords regularly because companies are afraid that hackers could steal important information. Many websites and apps send a text to your phone and they ask you to confirm who you are. This is much safer and not as easy for hackers. Also, your password should not be a single word but a combination of letters, numbers, and special symbols.	In March, a group of hackers said that they had breached 150,000 security cameras inside hospitals, companies, police departments, prisons, and schools. It resurfaced an important question among experts, academics, and consumers why there were so many people who were still so terrible at password security. A popular password comprised in data breaches is ‘123456’, and it´s closely followed by ´password´ or by a hybrid of the two ´password1´ or ´ABC123´. The reason people choose bad passwords or share them with colleagues and friends is because the more terrible they are, the easier they tend to be to remember. However, that also makes them super simple for attackers to try against your email address or username on a website or an app. This is one of the reasons why many companies insist on their employees changing their passwords regularly. When you can, you should switch on two-factor authentication where you log in and get a text sent to your phone to confirm your identity. Also, if your password contains words or something that you can speak out loud easily, it´s probably too insecure.

A team of people make a small shelter for homeless people. Homeless people do not have a home. They sometimes sleep in the street. But it is too cold in winter. The team must test the shelter first. They test it in the German city of Ulm. The shelter will protect people from cold and wind. Light is inside. One person can be inside. It is a safe place. The shelter has a door. The door unlocks in the evening. A homeless person can go inside. Social workers get a message that somebody is inside. Social workers check the shelter in the morning. They clean it. Somebody else can use it the next night.	A team of people made a special sleeping pod for homeless people. They are testing it in the city of Ulm, Germany. It is necessary to check if the pod is warm enough to keep homeless people safe from cold and wind. If the test is successful, the team wants to put the pods in other German cities, too. The pod has a solar panel on the roof which makes light and it also opens the door. The pod is from metal and wood and it is suitable for one person. The door unlocks in the evening and someone, who has no place to sleep, can stay inside. The pod is warm and there is fresh air inside. When the door opens, social workers get a message. They check and clean the place the next day to make sure that it is ready for another person.	The southern German city of Ulm is currently testing a prototype sleeping pod for the homeless, which its makers call a nest. The windproof and waterproof pods have been installed in the streets of the city and tests are underway to check if they protect against frostbite . If so, they could be rolled out across Germany. The nest has a solar panel on its roof to power lights and it is big enough to fit one person. It unlocks itself automatically in the evening which means that someone who needs a place to sleep can simply open the door and find a safe place overnight. The nest protects against the cold, wind and also against attacks. To ensure privacy, there are no cameras inside; however, the opening of the doors triggers a motion sensor which alerts social workers who check the pod after it´s been used to ensure that it can be cleaned.

With numbers expected to increase in the coming days, the leader of the fishermen’s co-operative in the area said the mass fish death was caused by high levels of pollution at the bottom of the lagoon. Local authorities have blamed natural phenomena but state authorities and environmental investigators have rejected this, blaming “poor management”. Attention has now turned to the wastewater treatment plants that operate nearby, and mud from the plants could be to blame.

Bezos thanks his employees and people who buy things from Amazon. Bezos says that they pay for his trip. Some people are angry. They say that other things are more important than visiting space.	Last week, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, visited space. Bezos and three other people traveled 107 kilometers above the Texas desert in a rocket which belonged to Bezos´s company. The space trip lasted about 10 minutes, and the rocket then returned safely to Earth. Among the crew were Bezos´s brother Mark, an 82-year-old pilot named Wally Funk, and an 18-year-old Dutch student named Oliver Daemen. Daemen´s father bought the ticket in an auction , and he gave it to his son who always dreamed to get into space. After the flight, Bezos thanked his employees and Amazon customers , and he said that they paid for the flight. This made many people angry. Some politicians said that Bezos could give the money to his employees instead of traveling to space.	Jeff Bezos, the richest man on Earth, visited space on Tuesday. He and three other crew members soared about 107 kilometers above the Texas desert aboard his company Blue Origin´s New Shepard rocket. A historic unpiloted sub-orbital flight helped to inaugurate a new era of private commercial space tourism.  The trip to the edge of space lasted about 10 minutes and 20 seconds, including a few minutes of weightlessness. The crew included his brother Mark, Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pioneering female aviator, and Oliver Daemen, an 18-year-old Dutch physics student. Bezos, who recently stepped down as Amazon´s CEO, thanked employees and customers of the company that he founded, saying that their hard work and Amazon purchases had made his space flight possible. His words sparked criticism, with some politicians saying that Amazon abused its market power to hurt small businesses. They also said Bezos should have spent the money to pay his workers fairly and protect their health.
It is April 2019. Fire destroys the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France. It is a sad moment for many French people. Notre Dame is one of the most important buildings in France. It is necessary to repair the cathedral. The French president wants to repair the cathedral through 2024. Many people think that it is not possible. It is not easy to find so many trees to repair it. The trees must be at least one meter wide and 18 meters long. People must cut down around 1,000 trees in different French forests. They must work fast. The wood starts to get wet in spring. The wood must get dry. It lasts 18 months. Then, it is possible to build the cathedral.	In April 2019, fire destroyed the top of the Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, France. The French government decided that the cathedral would look the same as before the fire. The French president promised to repair the cathedral through 2024, but it is a very hard task. It was not easy to find the right trees to repair it because they needed to be at least one meter wide and 18 meters long. Lumberjacks must cut down around 1,000 oaks in 200 French forests. They must work fast because it is important to cut the trees down before spring starts. In spring, the wood becomes too wet. After the cutting, the trees need 18 months to get dry.	Ancient French oaks have been felled after they had been selected to reconstruct the fallen spire of Notre Dame in Paris, France. A nationwide hunt for the right timber began after it was decided that the spire would need to be rebuilt exactly as it was before it was destroyed in an April 2019 blaze. The trees needed to have trunks at least one meter wide and 18 meters long. Around 1,000 oaks from more than 200 French forests have been selected; however, the timber harvesting must be completed by the end of March which will prevent tree sap and moisture from entering the wood fibers. The oaks will then be left to dry for up to 18 months. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised to rebuild the cathedral by 2024; however, it has been considered an unlikely timeline.

People want to go to Mars. One million people can live on Mars in 2060. Elon Musk says this. People make a model of a house. Houses like this can be on Mars. You can see the model in Greenwich, London. The air inside the house is good. The house also gets water for you. The atmosphere on Mars is very humid . The house gets the water from the atmosphere. People on Mars can have 3D printers. They can print everything that they need.	In London, people made a model of a Martian house at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich. People designed the house to be situated in Valles Marineris, which is a system of canyons that runs along the equator of Mars. The Martian atmosphere is about 100% humid on most nights, so the house will pull out the water from it. The house will provide oxygen for people as well. People on Mars will have 3D printers, which can make almost everything that they would need, from tools to plates and toothbrushes. This all may sound like science fiction, but a million people could be living on Mars by the mid-2060s, according to Elon Musk.	National Geographic, Royal Observatory Greenwich astronomers, and Stephen Petranek, the author of “How We’ll Live on Mars”, created a model of what could once be a Martian house. People built it at the Royal Observatory Greenwich in London.

There is a big technology conference in Las Vegas. More than 100,000 people and 4,500 sellers meet here. They introduce the latest products and ideas in consumer electronics. However, a lot of business happens here, too. Companies that sell household products want to know what their customers want. Technology innovators start to connect more household products together in the virtual world. They believe that it is a good idea with many good parts. The problem is that nobody knows who can see the information about these products. It can be the police, or an insurance company , or somebody else. It is difficult to imagine how they can use this information in the future.	A big technology show is starting in Las Vegas. Over 100,000 people and 4,500 sellers are showing the latest innovations in consumer electronics. There are some strange products; for example, there is a wearable subwoofer or a smart helmet for cyclists. However, this show is not only about technology but also about business. Companies try to find out what products to put in their stores. Tech innovators come with new ideas and start connecting products together in cyberspace . They believe that it can be useful, but people can also use privacy. It is also unclear who can have access to this information in cyberspace and how they can use it.	The annual trade show of consumer electronics, CES, is starting in Las Vegas. Over 100,000 people and 4,500 vendors showing the newest innovations are spreading across the Las Vegas Strip. This show is about a lot more than seeking the latest news in technology. There is a lot of business happening too, as household companies try to figure out what to put in their stores. Visitors can watch big trends , such as the growth of 5G, the utility of autonomous cars, and privacy. Tech innovators start connecting everything that people own to cyberspace, and they are building a digital trail of people´s lives. Everything that a person owns could have some sort of interaction with the network. This has some advantages; however, it also means a loss of privacy at some level, and the question remains who has access to that information.

Pandas eat bamboo. Bamboo is very hard. It is not easy to digest , but pandas can do it! This is very interesting to scientists. They want to know how the pandas do it. They study their poo . Scientists want to create a biofuel . This biofuel is made from plants. The information from panda poo can help the scientists. Pandas only eat some parts of the bamboo. Scientists want to know why, also.	Scientists are studying the poo of giant pandas. The scientists want to know how the pands digest bamboo. Bamboo is very hard, and originally pandas ate meat. They adapted to a diet which consists of bamboo only. Pandas also only eat some parts of the bamboo, and the experts want to know why. The scientists are interested in this because they can learn from it. The results may show new cheaper ways to produce so-called second generation biofuels . These biofuels are made from plants and biomass .	It may all be all a load of poo , but scientists say panda excrement could hold the key to developing new biofuels. Belgian researchers are examining giant panda faeces to try to understand how they can digest tough bamboo. They’re hoping for clues on how to develop new generations of biofuel. While the genetic make-up of endangered pandas is carnivorous , the animals have adapted to a diet consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. “So it’s a huge  feat for this animal to digest something as hard. And also, they only eat certain parts of bamboo. They give them 30 kilograms of bamboo every day, and they eat maybe 10 kilograms. So if I have a piece of bamboo, you’ll see certain parts are eaten and others are not, and we don’t understand very well why.” Researchers plan to study microorganisms in the animal’s gut , before turning their attention to its digestive tracts. “So the prime reason we take the poo is we know that it’s the bugs , the microorganisms living in the panda that digest all that tough food. So we’re going to take the excrement, we’re going to put that in the reactors and see how the digestion works.” According to the team composed of Belgian, Italian and Chinese scientists, the toughness of bamboo stalks could be potentially helpful for studying the processing of fibrous material. The results may point to new, cheaper, ways to produce so-called second generation biofuels made from plants and biomass .
This first happens 600 years ago. Spain’s leaders let shepherds move their animals. This is because of the seasons. When it gets cold, the shepherds move them to warmer places.

It isn’t big. It is just 10 centimetres across .	A bright  flash of light illuminated the night sky of Scotland. People took pictures of it and many posted the pictures on social media. They talked about what it could mean, and some said that it was the end of the world. However, it probably was just a meteor. Experts say that it was no more than about 10 centimetres across, so it wasn’t quite Armageddon.	A bright flash of light illuminates the sky, as what’s believed to be a meteor, streaks across the sky in Scotland, which the UK Met Office has confirmed wasn’t weather-related. Many Scots reported seeing this astonishing sight in the early evening sky. Images of the phenomenon started circulating on social media with some speculating on what it could mean and others taking to Twitter to somewhat dramatically declare that it was a sign of the end of the world. Captured on car dash-cam , the scene seems like any normal evening drive until the sky suddenly lights up and a travelling spotlight looks to be falling down to earth. Other CCTV  footage like this one here shows a dramatic flash of white, prompting many to report the unusual event to the police. But despite all the furore , experts claim that meteors are no more than a speck of dust. And that if this is one, it would have been no more than about 10 centimetres across. So it wasn’t quite Armageddon as was suggested on social media.
The word “burkini” is from the words “burka” and “bikini.” It is a swimsuit for women. Muslim women wear it. It covers their body. Only their face, hands and feet are not covered. Some people have a problem with the burkini. In 2009, people banned a woman from a swimming pool in Paris. Now, some French resorts are banning the burkini, too. The French Prime Minister is also against the burkini. Other people are OK with it. They say that the ban is an infringement of rights . Critics say that the ban could make some Islamic terrorists angry.	Burkini is a newly created word from the words “burka” and “bikini.” It is a swimsuit that covers a woman’s body. Only her face, hands and feet are not covered. In 2009, people banned a woman from a public pool in Paris for wearing a burkini. Now, many French resorts are banning it completely. Some people say that this is an infringement of rights, and that they would not care if somebody besides them wore it. Others, like the French Prime Minister, want to ban the burkini altogether. Many critics say that the ban could provoke Islamic terrorists.	It´s rare that an item of clothing sparks such controversy , even to the point of polarising a nation, but after recent incidents of women being asked to remove their burkini in French beach resorts, it’s safe to say that this piece of fabric, has truly got people talking. The so-called burkini is a linguistic melange of the Muslim garment , the burka, with a bikini. A swimsuit that covers a woman’s body, leaving only her face, hands and feet exposed. Seemingly inoffensive , in 2009 a woman was banned from a public pool in Paris for wearing the item. Now, in the secular country, many French resorts are banning the garment entirely . Although not everyone agrees, this French beach-goer says, “If someone besides him want to wear a burkini, he wouldn’t really care and that the majority of the population sees the ban as an infringement of rights.” However, Prime Minister Manuel Valls defends the hard-line approach, calling the burkini a symbol of enslavement of women. He says that asking someone to remove their burkini is like if a woman in a public area were indecent , they’d too be asked to cover up. Many critics argue that the ban could provoke violent reaction from Islamic terrorists in a country that’s already endured a slew of attacks. It may just be a piece of material, but for many, clearly, the burkini has a lot more underlying meaning to it.

The weather in some parts of the US is getting drier and hotter. Wildfires happen more often. Farmers have an idea on how to stop the fires. They use goats. Goats eat grass and leaves. This helps stop the spread of fires. Goats are better than cows or sheep. Goats have long necks. They can eat leaves which are two meters high. They can climb on rocks.

People feel safer because fires will not come. Also, they do not need to mow their land.	Farmers in California, US, use goats to stop fires which are becoming more and more frequent in the southwestern part of the US. How does it work? Farmers get goats which eat dry grass and brush . Goats can get to rocky cliffs and to other places where cows or sheep cannot get. Goats can stretch their necks up to 2 meters, and they bite branches and leaves. One goat which weighs 45 kilograms can eat 5.5 kilograms of brush. Companies or people pay money to ranchers who bring their goats in trailers. It is a good business for ranchers and a big help for people who are afraid of wildfires.	Landowners in California, US, are turning to herds of goats as a unique, environmentally-friendly tool to clear debris . Goats clear away brush that could become fuel for fires, and they eat a lot. A single 45-kilogram goat can chow  down 5.5 kilograms of brush in a day, so a herd of about 560 adult goats can clear about 3,000 kilograms. At Mike Canada´s California ranch, there are about 10,000 sheep and goats who wait for their turn to ride the trailer to their latest deployment . With wildfires intensifying in recent years, Mike´s business is booming. Goats can stretch their necks up to 2 meters, biting branches and low-lying leaves. They eat poison oak, and they can clear rocky cliffs, which is something livestock cannot do. Hundreds of public agencies, businesses, and private owners across the state have turned to these goats because it´s much easier than mowing or using chemicals. A lot of food for a goat is a lifesaving tool for humans.

According to analysts, Depop could be a real threat to traditional retailers because the younger generation and influencers like to create one-of-a-kind outfits at a great price. However, there are questions about ethics , too. Some young sellers buy clothing in bulk , and then they sell them on the online store for twice the price. As more teens turn to the app, some people fear that sustainability might lose out to profitability.

Utah is an American state. It is in the Southwest. Capital punishment is legal there. Lethal injections are used in Utah. However, there are not enough of them. Also, the injections do not always kill fast. The prisoner can feel pain. This is a problem. Capital punishment must be fast. The prisoner must not feel pain. Some people think that it is better to shoot prisoners. They say that it is fast. Some people like this idea. Some people do not.	Utah is a state in the Southwestern United States and capital punishment is legal there. Until 2004, police executed the prisoners of Utah by shooting. In 2004, the state started to use lethal injections. However, there aren’t enough of these injections and they may be ineffective. Some injections do not kill the prisoners quickly and they make them feel pain. Some people say that death by shooting is more humane. Others say that it’s cruel. People voted on a new law which would let the state execute prisoners by shooting.	Lawmakers in Utah have voted to bring back executions by firing squad if lethal injections are not readily available.The news comes as a number of US states struggle to obtain lethal injection drugs amid a nationwide shortage and concerns over their effectiveness. European manufacturers have refused to sell the concoctions to US prisons and corrections departments over opposition to the death penalty. Many states have been led to consider alternative methods as supplies dwindle . Texas is said to have only enough drugs on hand to perform two more executions while the head of Utah’s prison system has said the state does not currently have any. Supporters of the legislation say three states – Oklahoma, Ohio and Arizona – recently carried out lethal injections that led to inmates’ physical distress and drawn-out deaths. They claim death by firing squad is more humane. Opponents, however, say it’s a cruel holdover from the state’s Wild West days and will earn it international condemnation . If approved by Governor Gary Herbert, the move would make Utah the only state in the country to permit the practice. It used firing squads for decades before adopting lethal injections in 2004.

Someone shot the first video in Scotland. It shows how a man casually crossed a crossing with two half barriers clearly in place. The man reached safety in seconds before a train went through. Another video shows a cyclist. He was approaching a crossing, and he didn’t see that the barriers were coming down. The barriers knocked him off of his bike.	The British Transport Police released frightening footage of people dicing  with death by level crossings. In the first clip, a pedestrian in Scotland casually walks around a crossing with two half barriers quite clearly in place. He reaches safety in seconds before a train goes through. Another clip shows a barrier crossing coming down and knocking a cyclist off his bike after he had seemed to ignore a warning light in England. A third video shows a driver finding herself on the rail track after the barriers had come down. She then drives backwards and forwards, trying to get to safety. Those involved in the footage were all very lucky not to be hurt, but the female driver was fined and given six points on her licence. A campaign called Operation Look released the clips to raise awareness. British Transport Police and Network Rail launched the campaign.
This is news is about a guitar. The guitar is the biggest guitar in the world. It is 43 feet long (13 metres) and 16 feet wide (almost 5 metres). It weighs 2,255 pounds. That is over a thousand kilos. The guitar is really big, but you can still play it! Scientists built it in Texas 10 years ago. It took a year to build it. They built it in a university. There are more guitars at the museum. The museum is only about guitars. There is another guitar which is also special . It is from a mammoth ’s tusk .	The world’s largest guitar is on display at a guitar museum in New Jersey, USA. It is 43 feet long (13 metres) and 16 feet wide (almost 5 metres). It weighs a massive 2,255 pounds which is over a thousand kilos. The cool thing about this guitar is not just the size, though. People can actually play the guitar. It was built in Texas about ten years ago as a project to teach engineering and physics. It took almost a year to build it. The huge guitar is not the only interesting one at the museum. There is a guitar which is partly made of a mammoth’s tusk .	There she is, the world’s largest playable guitar, and you don’t need the skills of Jimi Hendrix to give it a strum . The 43-foot-long (13 metres) Gibson is on display at a new exhibition all about guitars on at the moment at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City. Harvey Newquist from the National Guitar Museum is the organiser. “It was built by a science academy in Houston, Texas about ten years ago as a project to teach construction engineering and physics to students, and it took them almost a year to build it and right after they built it, the Guinness Book of Records certified it as the world’s largest playable guitar. And we do specify that it’s playable. It’s not just a sign. It’s not a picture. It can actually be strummed. It doesn’t sound necessarily the sweetest of all guitars, but it can be played.” The guitar is 16 feet (almost 5 metres) wide and weighs a massive 2,255 pounds, over a thousand kilos and more than 150 stones. It’s not the only interesting guitar on display at this travelling exhibition. This one’s partly made up of the ivory from a woolly mammoth.
This news is about a man. His name is Manu. He is from India. Manu has an accident. He loses his hands. Another man has an accident, too. He dies, but his hands are OK. Doctors take these hands. They transplant them onto Manu. Manu is very happy. He can do regular activities again. This is India’s first hand transplant. It is a great achievement .	Doctors carried out India’s first hand transplant. It was a great achievement for the Asian subcontinent. It took 20 doctors 16 hours to conduct the double hand transplant. The man who received the operation works in event management. He lost his hands when he fell out of a moving train. He said at a news conference that he is very happy and he can now do all of his regular activities. Doctors transplanted his new hands from a 24-year-old man who died in a road accident.	Doctors have successfully conducted India’s first double hand transplant. On Saturday, it was announced that train accident victim Manu successfully underwent surgery at the Amrita Institute of Medical Science. He received the hands of a 24-year-old road accident victim, which involved 20 surgeons and took over 16 hours over January 12th and 13th. At a news conference on Saturday Manu said he’s delighted with his new hands. “I am very happy. After I lost my hands, I was very scared but now I am happy that my hands have been operated on and restored , and I can do all of my regular activities.” The breakthrough surgery has been hailed as a major achievement for India. It’s the first time a hand transplant has been carried out in the Asian subcontinent and probably the first where the transplant has been done on non white skin. Manu, who works in event management, lost his hands when he was thrown out of a moving train after trying to stop a group of people disturb a female passenger.
A spacecraft went into space in 2004. It moved between the Earth and Mars first. Then it started to travel to a comet . It traveled around 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometres). The spacecraft is 100 kilometres from the comet now. The comet is the end of the journey . It is very interesting to experts. The spacecraft studies the comet. Experts are interested in the comet’s history . They want to know the comet’s material. It can answer many important questions.	People launched a spacecraft in March 2004. It traveled more than 4 billion miles (6.4 billion kilometres) since then. At first, it moved between the Earth and Mars because the right direction had to be set. Now, the 10-year journey comes to an end, and the real science can begin. The spacecraft is only 100 kilometres from the comet, so experts can start analysing and measuring it. They want to find out what its history is and what it’s made of. It could even answer some questions about the birth of the solar system or life itself.	After a decade -long mission, a European spacecraft has arrived at a comet more than 250 million miles away. The Rosetta spacecraft launched in March 2004 and since then has traveled more than 4 billion miles across the asteroid belt and more than five times the Earth’s distance from the Sun. And now, as the 10-year journey across the solar system comes to an end, Rosetta has entered orbit around the comet. “Well, today’s the end a 10-year journey through the solar system. We’ve been bouncing around between the Earth and Mars to try to get our orbit right to get out to this completely insane object which we now know is out there, 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, the wildest comet, I think, anybody’s ever seen. So, today we arrive. We’re there 100 kilometres away. If you like, today is the beginning of the real science mission because now we can start actually measuring things, really analysing this comet, finding out what its history is, where it’s been in the solar system, what it’s made of. Can we open up this treasure chest and find out some answers to the birth of the solar system, the origin of water on the planet and even origin of life itself?” Scientists at the European Space Agency are now on a tight schedule to learn enough about the comet using data from Rosetta to safely land the spacecraft’s probe on it in November.
Scientists study birds. They want to know how they fly. They put a camera on a bird. This type of bird hunts smaller birds. It catches them in the air. The camera films this. Scientists learn from the video. The bird’s flight is special. The bird can see very well. This helps the bird to catch small birds.	A great video, which was taken in Belgium in 2011, emerged. It was taken by a camera which was fixed on a falcon ’s back. Scientists used the video to study falcons. The scientists were interested in the physics of flight while the birds hunt. The video revealed to scientists that the birds use a kind of “motion camouflaging ”, as they fly to catch their dinners. The birds also use their wide field of vision to keep their eyes fixed on their prey .	Scientists mounted a camera on a falcon’s back to study the physics of flight while the birds are hunting. The videos revealed that the birds use a kind of “motion camouflaging ”, as they zigzag , trying to catch their next dinner. The predators also use their wide field of vision to keep their eyes firmly fixed on their prey while they move in the air.

Normal trains have wheels . These wheels move on tracks . However, magnetic trains have no wheels. Magnets move magnetic trains in the air. The train touches nothing – only air. Magnetic trains are fast. People test a Japanese magnetic train. It sets a new record. Its top speed is 374 miles per hour (602 kilometres per hour). Nagoya is a Japanese city. It is 173 miles (278 kilometres) from Tokyo. Now, the journey takes 80 minutes. With the new train, the journey can take 40 minutes.	Magnetic trains can go really fast. Electrically charged magnets lift and move them. These magnets are around 4 inches (10 centimetres) above the tracks. Japan’s maglev train broke its own world record. The seven-car levitation train hit a top speed of 374 miles per hour (602 kilometres per hour) in a test run near Mount Fuji. Japan wants to introduce the service between Tokyo and the central city of Nagoya by 2027. The 173-mile journey (278 kilometres) would take only about 40 minutes.	Japan’s maglev train has broken its own world record. The seven-car magnetic levitation train hit a top speed of 374 miles per hour (602 kilometres per hour) in a test run near Mount Fuji. The new record comes less than a week after it clocked in at 366 miles per hour (589 kilometres per hour). It’s propelled and lifted by electrically charged magnets that are around 4 inches (10 centimetres) above the tracks. Central Japan Railway which owns the trains wants to introduce the service between Tokyo and the central city of Nagoya by 2027.The 173-mile journey (278 kilometres) would take only about 40 minutes – less than half the current time. The maglev currently holds the Guinness World Record title for the fastest maglev train at 361 miles per hour (581 kilometres per hour). It gained that in 2003 but it’s now planning to reapply with its new world speed record.
In Britain, there are many knife attacks. They happen more and more often. In the first two months of 2019, there are 20 murders just in London. Young people often attack other young people. A former boss of the London police talks about the problem. He says that this happens because of three things. First, there is too much cocaine in Britain. Second, too many people carry knives. Third, young men do not worry about the consequences . These are the things which happen to them after they attack somebody.	In Britain during the first March weekend, two teenagers were stabbed to death, and one of them was a 17-year-old girl from East London. Knife attacks are a big problem in Britain and they happen more and more often. The number of young people (younger than 18) who were stabbed has doubled in the last five years. In the first two months of 2019, there were 20 murders in London alone. The former highest police officer of London thinks that there are three reasons for this. Firstly, too many people carry knives; secondly, cocaine is too cheap, and thirdly, many young men do not care about the consequences of their actions.	Britain’s first March weekend was marked by more knife crimes after two teenagers were killed. One of them was 17-year-old Jodie, who was stabbed to death in a park near her home in East London. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said that it was a tragic, senseless loss of life. The former police commissioner said that there has been a 93% rise in the number of young people (younger than 18) who have been stabbed over the last five years – that is almost double. He thinks that one of the reasons for the violence is a high supply of cocaine which makes it cheap. The second obvious reason is that there are too many people carrying knives, and the third is that there are too many young men who do not care about the consequences of carrying a knife. In the country’s capital alone, there have been 20 murders so far this year, including five in just a week.

The coronavirus is in many countries. Children cannot go to school. They stay at home. They learn with their parents. Parents have a new job. They are substitute teachers. They are the teachers for their children. It is a new situation for many parents and children. It can bring many problems. Children cannot see their school friends. Also, children do not understand why they are staying at home. Parents think that their children must work hard. They do not understand that every child is different. Some children need a lot of time to learn. Experts say that parents must be kind and thoughtful . Parents can make teaching fun. They can practice with children during common activities that they do together. For example, they can practice math during cooking. It is also important to talk with the school and teachers.	Many schools around the world closed because of the coronavirus. Parents must be a substitute teacher, and they learn with their children at home. It is not an easy task. Some parents expect that their children will work as hard as they do in school. However, parents need to understand that every child is different and works at different speeds. It is important to be kind and thoughtful . It does not have to be boring to learn. It can be fun, too. When parents teach their children math, they do not need to sit at the table and work with a book. Children can practice math during common activities such as baking or dining. Experts also say that it is important to communicate with the school and teachers and to stay in contact with school friends.	As schools around the world are closed, millions of parents now find themselves playing the role of a substitute teacher. For some parents, it may be hard to accept that their children are not at the same pace as they were before the coronavirus pandemic. Experts say that it is important to accept that a student is never truly falling behind and that he is just moving at his own pace. Parents are advised to give their children a bit of grace . It is not necessary to sit down and do some math problems; instead, parents can make learning more enjoyable. For example, they can practice conversions while baking or talking about area and perimeter of their dining table or their bedroom. Constant communication with the teacher is essential too, and now, it is even more essential than before.
People in the US see big hornets . A hornet looks like a wasp. However, it is bigger. It is more dangerous than a wasp. Hornets have a stinger . It is a sharp end or their bodies. A person can die if a hornet stings him. The hornets come from Asia. They kill more than 50 people in Japan every year. Scientists do not understand how the hornets get to the US. The hornets are only in Washington State. People who take care of bees in Washington are worried. They find many dead bees. They think that hornets kill the bees. Officials warn people. It is not a good idea to kill the hornets. People must call a professional. He comes and kills the hornets.	People in the US spotted Asian giant hornets . It is the first time that people have spotted them in the US. Beekeepers in Washington State think that the hornets killed their bees. The beekeepers found many dead bees without their heads. Hornets are about two inches long, and they have a powerful sting . If a person gets a lot of stings, he can die. The media says that hornets kill about 50 people in Japan every year. People saw hornets only in Washington State, and nobody knows why. Scientists do not know how the hornets got to the US; however, they advise people not to try to kill them. If someone sees a hornet, he should call an organization in Washington´s government.	For the first time, Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the US. Researchers call the bee-killing bugs ´murder hornets´. Beekeepers in Washington State have reported piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off , and they linked them to the hornets. The two-inch-long insects carry a sting that can be deadly to humans if a person gets stung multiple times. According to The New York Times, hornets kill about 50 people a year in Japan. The giant hornets have only been seen in the Washington State area, and scientists do not know how they got to the US. Officials advise people that if they see a hornet, they should alert Washington´s Department of Agriculture and not try to kill the hornet themselves.
This happens in Tomsk, Russia. A fire starts at a pig farm. There are about 200 pigs there. The fire is very big. It is 700 metres big. Seven fire engines and 26 firefighters fight the fire. Firefighters come out to put the fire out . They also save the pigs. The piglets  squeal as the firefighters carry them out.	In Tomsk, Russia, a fire started at a pig farm that had about 200 pigs. Firefighters arrived to put out the fire and rescue the pigs, which included squealing  piglets .

Firefighters rescued squealing piglets from a fire at a farm in Tomsk, Russia. There were about 200 pigs there when the blaze broke out. One firefighter reported that the whole roof of the farm was on fire when the firefighters arrived. He also said that the fire itself was 700 metres big, so it took seven fire engines and 26 firefighters to extinguish it. They were luckily there to save the pigs, as well.
Scientists study air pollution . From 1999 to 2015, they study it in the USA. They watch how much fine matter is in the air. This fine matter comes from industry, power plants and mostly cars. One piece of the matter is 30 times smaller than a human hair. If you breathe the matter in, it can go deep into your body. The scientists find that there is less and less of this fine matter. However, the pollution is dangerous. It connects to the death of 30,000 people.	From 1999 until 2015, scientists studied concentrations of fine matter pollution across the USA. The extremely small particles of pollution come from industry, power plants and mainly cars. They are 30 times smaller than a human hair, which means they can go deep into your body. Since 1999, the study found that this type of pollution went down. However, the pollution connects with around 30,000 deaths. One of the study’s authors said that it would be good for people if there was less of this pollution.	A recently published study analysed concentrations of fine particulate matter pollution across the continental US from 1999 until 2015. Industry, power plants and cars produce these extremely small particles of pollution. They are 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair, and they can be inhaled deep into the lungs, which can lead to a variety of health problems. The study found that this type of pollution declined since 1999, but the researchers say that even at levels below the current standard, air pollution linked to an estimated 30,000 deaths. One of the study’s lead authors said that lowering the standard below the current level would likely improve people’s health.
It is the year 1918. The world is at war. It is World War I. There is another problem. A flu hits many countries in the world. The US wants to win the war. It is not a good idea to give people information about the flu. Men and boys must fight. They must think only about the war. The US government makes a special law. The law has an impact on journalist. If journalists write bad things about the US government, they can go to prison. Journalists do not want to go to prison. They write about the war. They do not write about the flu. The flu is deadly . People can die quickly. People do not have information about the flu. Many people become ill. Around 675,000 Americans die from the flu.	In 1918, a flu hit the world, and the pandemic became the worst in US history. Between 1918 and 1919, about 675,000 Americans died and the reason why the number was so high was World War I and war propaganda . The US president Woodrow Wilson needed men and boys to fight. If people knew about the flu, it could have an impact on the war. The US government passed a law that changed the way how journalists informed people. If journalists wrote something bad about the government, they could go to prison. Newspapers wrote only about the war and little information was about the flu. The 1918 flu was very deadly , and people could die 12 hours after the first signs of the disease. People bled from the nose, mouth, eyes, and ears.	The 1918 flu was the worst pandemic in US history. Propaganda , as well as a law threatening prison for criticizing the US government, encouraged newspapers to censor the flu and it cost lives. Between 1918 and 1919, an estimated 675,000 Americans died of influenza; however, negative news would hurt morale and damage the war effort. The US president Woodrow Wilson assembled a powerful propaganda machine. Some newspapers only covered the war, and they barely mentioned the pandemic, while others called it ordinary influenza. However, the 1918 Sedition Act meant that if journalists wrote anything disloyal about the US government, they faced 20 years in prison. From this flu, people could die 12 hours after the first symptoms that were bleeding from the nose and also the mouth, eyes, and ears. More Americans ended up dying from the 1918 flu than in the battles from the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War combined.

Marijuana is a drug. It comes from the hemp plant. People dry leaves and flowers from it. People then smoke it or eat it. The drug changes people´s minds. In the US, the government controls how people sell and use marijuana. Marijuana is legal in eleven US states. An important moment is in the US government. Marijuana can be legal in all US states. However, the US government must say yes to the bill . Some politicians do not agree with the bill. The bill can change some marijuana crimes. Judges will stop some marijuana cases. Marijuana crimes will not be in a person´s criminal record .	Marijuana is a drug made from the dried leaves or flowers of the hemp plant. People often smoke it or eat it in food. Marijuana is legal in eleven US states, and now, there is a chance that it will be legal in all US states. It is a historic moment because the House will vote on it for the first time. However, first, Congress must approve it, and some members of Congress said that they would not do it. If the government makes marijuana legal, officials will take marijuana off the list of controlled substances . Also, the MORE Act of 2019 means that judges could clear some marijuana cases. However, each US state can decide if it will make marijuana legal or not.	For the first time ever, a proposal to legalize marijuana in the US will go to a full House vote. The House is set to vote on the proposal during the week of the 21st of September; however, first, the bill needs to pass through both chambers of Congress. Senate Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already said that he is against it. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the MORE Act) of 2019 would take marijuana off the federal government´s list of controlled substances. It would also open the door for some marijuana-related crimes to be cleared. However, the sale of marijuana would still be up to individual states. Eleven US states and Washington, D.C., have already legalized marijuana.
Wet wipes are popular. Some people throw them in the toilet. This is not good. Wet wipes are different than toilet paper. The wipes combine with fats and oils in the sewers . They make blockages .

In Britain, 80% of blockages come from wet wipes and other un-flushable items. And this of course comes at a cost – 88 million pounds a year is shared between the British water companies and the taxpayers to remove the blockages. Some wet wipes are labelled as flushable, but they really are not. English water companies and charities are calling for all wet wipes to be labelled “do not flush”.

This giant stingray could be the biggest freshwater fish ever caught with a line and rod. The creature measures over 14 feet long (4.3 metres), eight feet wide (2.4 metres), and weighs over 800 pounds (363 kilograms). It was caught by American TV nature conservationist Jeff Corwin on the Mae Klong River in Thailand. “And she’s done all this cool stuff with it. We have genetic samples, we’ve got the measurements, we put in an identification tracking device so we know where she goes. But the best news about this stingray is we found out that she’s pregnant, and that’s great news for this species and for its future.” After various data was collected, the ray was released back into the river. As it could not be weighed without harming it, we may never know if it was truly a record beater. Nevertheless, the epic catch could help scientists figure out why these ancient creatures still swim in earth’s fresh waters and hopefully, make sure they still can in the future.

They say that any transgender athlete can compete as a woman provided her testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for at least 12 months before the first competition. However, some scientists argue that the guidelines do little to lessen the biological advantages of those who´ve gone through puberty as males and are therefore bigger or taller.

We are working hard to make their streets and community secure once again, but that will take time.” According to The Weather Underground website, Cyclone Winston is the strongest storm in the Southern Hemisphere since record-keeping began, making access to the island’s more remote communities complicated. In Winston’s wake , authorities and civilians get to grips with the scale of disaster after a government-imposed curfew had been lifted . It’s thought that as many as 8,000 people are holed up in evacuation centres across the islands. “I’d like to ask the government for help, for assistance, as soon as possible.” Fijians have been left startled by the extent of damage of the almost 200-mile per hour winds (322 kilometres per hour).

The spoons are a little longer. It is not always easy to eat with them at zero gravity . The food must be wet. Then it sticks to the spoon. The new spoon is very different. It is something between a spoon and chopsticks . You hold it in your hand. You press it at the end. The food stays on the spoon. It is easier to put food in your mouth. It will be possible to eat more kinds of food. Astronauts will be happier.	Nikolas Grafakos designed a new spoon which helps astronauts eat in space. Grafakos said that the new spoon can be important especially on long missions when it was very important to feel happy. The spoon, which astronauts use now, looks like the spoon we all use. It is a little longer, and it is not always easy for astronauts to use it. They need to eat food which is mushy and wet, so that it sticks to the spoon. The new spoon is something between a spoon and chopsticks . Astronauts can press it at the end, and they can control the food much more easily. If astronauts use the new spoon, they can eat more kinds of food, which will surely make them happier.	A new ´chopstick spoon´ to help astronauts eat in space has been designed by Nikolas Grafakos, who hopes that the spoon will help them eat lots of different types of food, especially during longer trips, like to Mars. Part of the Zero-G Cutlery collection, the new spoon enables astronauts to grab food in the zero gravity environment more easily, as they´re not relying on water surface tension to hold the food on the utensil or gravity to pull it down. Normally, the food needs to be very mushy and wet in order to stick to the spoon. The spoon that astronauts use now looks like an ordinary spoon, and it´s just a little bit longer. However, the new spoon is something between chopsticks and a spoon, and it allows astronauts to pinch the food at the end and control where the food goes a lot easier. The new spoon could possibly allow the introduction of drier food and more variety in food textures .

Elon Musk is the boss of SpaceX. SpaceX makes rockets. It wants to go to Mars. It wants to colonise Mars. It is working on a new rocket. Musk talks about the plan. SpaceX must make the tickets affordable to Mars. The first tickets can be expensive. Later, they can be between 200,000 dollars and 100,000 dollars. Earth and Mars are close every 26 months. This is a good time to go. SpaceX wants to go every 26 months. It wants to start in 2024. The journey can take from 6 to 9 months. It can be dangerous. You can die.	Elon Musk talked about his plan to colonise Mars at Mexico’s International Astronautical Congress. He explained that SpaceX is working on a rocket to transport people to Mars. The biggest problem is getting the cost for one ticket low enough. The first flights would be expensive, but the plan is to sell them from 200,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars. SpaceX plans to fly to Mars about every 26 months when Earth and Mars are closest. Musk said that he would like to land people on the planet as early as 2024. Musk said that it would be a challenge to fund the project. The rocket development costs alone are at 10 billion dollars over the next few years. Mars is typically around 225 million kilometres from Earth, and the journey would take 6 to 9 months. There would be no  guarantee of survival .	Tech billionaire Elon Musk outlined his plan to colonise Mars at Mexico’s International Astronautical Congress. He explained that SpaceX is developing a rocket and capsule to transport large numbers of people and cargo to Mars. Although he envisions humans living in a large colony there, he added that one key issue would be getting the cost down low enough to attract willing volunteers. The very first flights would be fairly expensive, but the architecture allows for a cost per ticket of less than 200,000 dollars and maybe as little as 100,000 dollars. SpaceX plans to fly to Mars about every 26 months when Earth and Mars are favourably aligned for flight. Musk said that he would like to land people on the planet as early as 2024. NASA’s first manned mission to Mars is expected about a decade later. Musk said that it would be a challenge to fund the project with the rocket development costs alone estimated at 10 billion dollars over the next few years. The nearly airless planet is typically around 225 million kilometres from Earth and landing the first humans there after a six-to-nine-month journey is an extremely ambitious goal. Musk admits that there would be no guarantee of survival for anyone signing up for the adventure.

A police officer kills a black man in the US. People in the US protest. They do not agree with police brutality . The situation is serious. Protests are in many US cities. The company Nike posts an ad on social media. The ad speaks to people. The ad says that people must not be quiet. People must say what they think. In the past, Nike supports a sportsman. The sportsman is a football player. He does not agree with police brutality in the US. Some people criticize Nike. However, the company Adidas supports Nike. Adidas says that together people can make a change.	People in the US are protesting against police brutality and racism, and companies react to it too. On Friday, the company Nike posted an ad on social media. The ad changed the company´s famous slogan ´Just Do It´. The ad said ´For Once, Don´t Do It.´ The idea is to urge people to fight against racism and police brutality in the US. It is important that people do not keep quiet, and that they say openly what they think. Another company, Adidas, supported Nike on social media. Adidas said that only together people can make a change. Some people criticized Nike in the past because the company supported a sportsman who protested against police brutality.	In the US, following nationwide protests against police brutality, the company Nike is encouraging people to speak up about racism and not remain silent. Nike posted the all-text ad on Friday, and it twists the brand´s famous slogan ´Just Do It´ by urging people to ´For Once, Don´t Do It.´ In the past, Nike was criticized for supporting anti-racism causes. For example, the company supported the former NFL star, Colin Kaepernick, who famously knelt during the national anthem instead of standing, as a form of a protest against police brutality in the US. Another sneaker brand, Adidas, responded to Nike´s ad in solidarity of the message. It said that only together people can make a change and move forward.
A farmer in an Indian village wakes up at night. He can hear an animal crying. He finds an elephant in his garden. The elephant falls in a well. A well is a deep hole in the ground.

The elephant had been roaming with two other elephants in the area before the incident. The farmer heard the cries of the animal and he alerted fire and rescue services. The well was about 17 meters deep and the water was at low level. However, rescuers had to pump it out before they could use trucks and cranes to pull the elephant out. Coconut tree leaves were dropped into the well to feed the animal before a veterinarian tranquilized her with two darts . The elephant was released into the forest area from where it came, and according to officials, it was in a good condition.
The situation with the coronavirus is very good in New Zealand. Only one person gets sick in the last four days. People are happy. The government is opening schools, restaurants, and businesses. Many countries in the world have a lot of problems with the coronavirus. However, New Zealand fights the virus quickly. Many people ask how it is possible. New Zealand lies on an island . The population is small. The virus spreads slowly. Also, the government works fast. The government closes borders , schools, and businesses when the virus starts in the country. The government speaks well with people. People follow strict rules. Medical workers test a lot of people in a short time. It helps stop the virus. The government asks people to be careful. The virus can come back.	It seems that New Zealand stopped the coronavirus there. In the past four days, there was only one new case of the virus, and the country is reopening schools, restaurants, and shops. Many people wonder why New Zealand is so successful in the fight with the virus. One reason is that the country lies on an island, and the population is small. The second reason is that New Zealand´s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, acted quickly at the start. When the coronavirus started in the country, the government closed borders, schools, and businesses. Ardern communicated well with the public, and people followed all government rules. The country had a good system of testing people, and doctors helped to find people who could be ill. However, Ardern said that people must be careful because there can be new cases of the virus.	As most of the world continues to fight with the coronavirus, New Zealand has almost eliminated the virus. The country reported only one new case in the past four days, and it is reopening schools, restaurants, and shops. New Zealand benefits from being a remote and sparsely populated island. New Zealand´s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, acted quickly, and she communicated clearly and compassionately from the start of the epidemic. In late March, with less than 100 cases, New Zealand closed borders, schools, and some businesses. Domestic travel was banned, and people were asked to stay at home. The country quickly reached high testing rates and used existing health records to track down people suspected of coming in contact with COVID-19. Ardern urged people to stay careful, and reopening businesses are required to keep records of customers, which helps trace new cases of the disease.
This news is from Chile. It is about a boy. He is only two years old. He is abandoned . A woman has a dog. The dog is pregnant . This means that the dog has milk. The woman finds the boy. He is suckling on the dog. The woman is shocked. She tells people about this. They are also very shocked.	A neighbour found a two-year-old abandoned boy. The woman was shocked when she saw that the child was suckling on her pregnant dog. This happened in Chile where child abandonment is a problem, and this incident shocked many people. On September 22nd, people will decide who will take care of the child.	A two-year-old boy has been taken into protective care after he was found by a neighbour feeding from her pregnant dog in Chile. Officers, who found the toddler in a scrap metal yard in a region close to the country’s border with Peru, said he was in a state of abandonment . The director of Chile’s National Service for Minors, Marcela Labraña, described the situation as completely inhumane. Neighbour Lori Escudero reported it to police after she witnessed the boy suckling on her pregnant dog. She says,” Everyone here, we’re all parents, and if you saw what we saw from my position as a woman, as a mother, it was terrible…” The case has sparked  outrage in Chile where child abandonment is a continuing issue. Child welfare  officials have taken custody of the toddler and a court hearing has been set for September 22nd to decide who cares for him in the future.
A company in San Francisco, US, makes salmon meat. The meat grows in a lab . The meat looks and tastes like real salmon. It is a similar color, too. It is not possible to buy it in a shop now. The company is not very big yet. It still seems that it will be possible in the future. Salmon is the most popular fish in the world. Sadly, the number of wild fish in the oceans is going down quickly. Salmon farms are in trouble because sea water is getting warmer. Another problem is that water in oceans is not clean. There are dangerous metals and microplastics in the water. They get in the fish meat. Then, people eat it. Salmon meat from the lab is clean. Also, it is as healthy as real salmon.	Salmon is the most eaten fish in the world, and the number of salmon in oceans is going down very quickly. At the same time, salmon farms are having troubles because sea water is getting warmer. A company in San Francisco, US, came up with an interesting idea. It makes salmon in a lab where it grows in special tanks . Experts use real salmon cells which grow and they look like real meat. The color and texture are very similar and it tastes good, too. This salmon does not have anything that most fish have nowadays. Since oceans water is dirty, fish have many dangerous things, for example microplastics and mercury .	A San Francisco-based cellular agriculture startup company has revealed the latest prototype of its cell-based salmon. The fish is made with real salmon cells that are grown in a brewery-like system in stainless steel tanks. A scaffold made from plant-based ingredients help the cells organize into a recognizable fish fillet shape. The company says that it aims to protect wild salmon and the oceans and help solve global food insecurity. Salmon is the second most consumed seafood after shrimp, and it´s the most consumed finfish. While demand for seafood is at an all-time high, wild fish continue to plummet , and salmon farms face warming coastal waters due to climate change. Fish are declining and there´s been a lot of movement toward alternative proteins. The lab-grown salmon will provide the same nutritional benefits as wild-caught fish without contaminants such as mercury, microplastics or antibiotics.
This happens in a zoo. The zoo is in Israel. A gorilla has an accident. She falls into a moat . She cannot get back. She is small. She is three years old. The gorilla’s big sister sees this. She wants to help. She gets down into the moat. The little sister gets on her back. The big gorilla tries to climb up the moat wall. She is not successful , but she finds another way. This way is better. Both gorillas are fine.	A three-year-old gorilla fell into a five-metre moat in a zoo in Israel, but her older sister came to the rescue . The big sister got down into the moat and let her sibling climb on her back. The big sister tried to climb up the moat wall, but there was a power cable. She got scared and fell down. The pair later successfully climbed up the other side of the moat.	A gorilla in Israel Safari zoo came to the rescue of her younger sister yesterday after she fell into a five-metre moat . A passing visitor filmed the three-year-old gorilla named Amelia falling into the ditch . Her eight-year-old sister Ania then carried her on her back, attempting to climb up the moat wall but was scared off by a power cable and fell down. The zoo spokesman said the pair then successfully climbed up the other side of the moat onto the visitor’s area which was evacuated by the zoo staff. After Amelia recovered, all gorillas who are kept at the night house were released back into their open yard.
People bring predators to Australia. These are animals like wild cats and foxes. They are now killing many small, endangered animals. Australian scientists want to help these animals. They try new techniques . One idea is to build homes for the animals. The homes protect them from the predators. The animals already want to live in the homes. They do not have many places to hide. The scientists also need help from people. These people work outside on the land. They want them to help with the animal protection.	In Australia, people introduced predators such as wild cats and foxes, and these animals are now killing off the small, endangered mammals that live there. Australian researchers want to save the mammals, and they are trying new techniques, such as building homes that protect animals from the predators. The animals already want to use the homes because there are less places to hide as the climate changes. The researchers also need help from the people that work on the land to help with the animal conservation .	The harsh Australian desert has animal graveyards due to predators that were introduced to the area and that are now wiping out the small, endangered mammals that live there. The predators are animals such as feral cats and foxes. Sydney University researchers want to save the mammals, and one professor said that it is impossible to control the predator numbers in such ‘ vast , expansive landscapes’, so the researchers are trying alternative techniques. One idea is to build ‘predator -proof ’ homes, and the animals are willing tenants to move into the homes as the changing climate has taken away places to hide. The researchers also need help from the people that work on the land to assist with the animal conservation .
This news is from Germany. A politician is at a meeting. It is her party ’s meeting. A young man comes up to her. He hits her in the face with a pie. Refugees are coming to Germany. The politician wants to limit the number of the refugees. Maybe, the man hits her with the pie because of this.	A German politician was sitting in the front row during a speech at her party ’s conference. She is the member of Germany’s far left party. A young man stopped in front of her and threw a chocolate pie in her face. Security guards quickly pulled him away and asked reporters not to film the politician. The politician says that there should be a limit of refugees who come to Germany. This is an opinion, which her party does not agree on. She is the second politician someone attacked with a dessert over a position. A person hit a member of an anti-immigrant party with a pie last month.	Targeted by a self-styled anti- fascist over her stance on refugees, German politician Sahra Wagenknecht was yesterday hit in the face with a chocolate cream pie. Wagenknecht, who is a member of Germany’s far left Linke Party, was sitting in the front row during the opening speech at a party conference when a young man stopped in front of her and threw the pie in her face. The man was quickly pulled away by security guards as party officials asked reporters not to film the politician and shielded her from the cameras. Wagenknecht previously advocated  putting a  cap on the number of refugees Germany should accept – a stance from which her party has distanced itself. She is the second politician to be attacked with a dessert over her position in recent weeks – a member of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party having suffered a similar fate just last month.
The Black Sea is a sea in the east of Europe. Russia has a coastline on the Black Sea. People in a Russian town see something special. It is a waterspout . A waterspout looks like a tornado. It is weaker than a tornado, however.	Last week, tourists on the Russian Black Sea coast saw a large waterspout which is rare there. Waterspouts look like tornadoes but they are much weaker.	Last week, tourists on the Russian Black Sea coast witnessed a sight rare for the location – a large waterspout . Waterspouts look similar to tornadoes, but they are typically far weaker.
There is a competition in the USA. The competition chooses the ugliest dog. One dog wins. He is from North Carolina. He is small. He has an ugly face. It looks like the face of a small horse. He looks angry, too. Other dogs are also ugly. One dog has no hair. Another dog has no nose. However, only one dog can be the ugliest. The ugliest dog’s owner gets $1,500. She will use her money to help other animals.	The 2014 World’s Ugliest Dog Competition has its winner. His name is Peanut and he is from North Carolina in the USA. The dog is small and he has a face of a tiny angry horse. He competed with dogs who were hairless, had warts , and one had no nose! However, Peanut was the ugliest one. Like many dogs in the competition, Peanut’s owner saved him from a shelter . The competition gives her $1,500. She says that she will use the money to help other animals.	It may surprise you to know this, but you’re currently looking at an award-winning animal. This is Peanut, winner of the 2014 world’s ugliest dog competition in Petaluma, California. An accolade that rewarded, or perhaps that should be compensated, owner Holly Chandler to the tune of $1,500. The award-winning dog who, let’s be honest , has the face of a tiny, angry horse, saw off competition from a number of homely  hounds in order to take home the prize. Some were hairless, some had warts and one even appeared to be missing a nose, but none of them turned the heads and the stomachs of judges quite like Peanut. Like many dogs in the competition, Peanut was rescued from a shelter. Ms Chandler, who came all the way from North Carolina for the competition, says she plans to use the prize money to help other abused animals pay vet bills back home.
It is very dry in California. It does not rain for a long time. California tries to save water. People make many black balls. The black balls save water. People move the balls into water. The balls stay on the surface of the water. The balls stop the sun. They also stop aquatic plants and birds. One ball costs 36 cents. The balls work for 20 years. They save 1.1 million cubic metres of water every year.	California is in its fourth year of a catastrophic  drought , so it tries to save as much water as possible. People released thousands of black balls into a water reservoir in Los Angeles. These balls cost 36 cents each and they float on the surface of water. They protect the water from heat, stop aquatic plants from growing, and keep birds away. The balls work for 20 years and they will save 1.1 million cubic metres of water every year.	It looks like a massive kids’ play park, but the reason for these black plastic balls has nothing to do with fun. The Las Virgenes County water district in Los Angeles has decided to put the balls on top of the water to block the sunlight from hitting it. The so-called shade balls are the brainchild of David Pedersen. “The balls, really, they’re intended for three reasons: they help to cut down on evaporation , that’s helped us save water; and then it also helps to prevent algae from growing in the reservoir, so it improves our water quality; and then finally as a side benefit, it helps keep the birds off the surface and birds do their thing and that causes a problem.” This week, the mayor of Los Angeles released 20 thousand black balls into the Los Angeles reservoir. California is in its fourth year of a catastrophic drought that has led the state to issue a series of steps to reduce water consumption. The shade balls work for two decades. They cost 36 cents each and are expected to save some 300 million gallons (1,135,624 cubic metres) of water annually .
Ceuta is a Spanish enclave in Morocco. An enclave is an area where people live. Spanish people live there. Many Moroccan people want to go to Ceuta. They want to get to Europe. They believe that they can live better lives in Europe. 8,000 people get to Ceuta last week. Many people are very young. They swim in the sea. It is very dangerous. They get to the Spanish coast. Police wait there. Police stop the people. They return half of the people to Morocco. Many people are still in Ceuta. Spanish officials criticize the Moroccan government. Morocco does not stop Moroccan people on its border . Morocco does not care about the EU rules.	Last week, almost 8,000 Moroccan people got into Spain´s enclave of Ceuta. These people did not want to live in Morocco, and they thought that they could live better lives in Spain. More than 25% of the migrants were people younger than 18 years. They swam to Ceuta which was very dangerous because the waves were big. Problems started near Morocco´s border when police tried to stop the migrants. Spanish authorities said that they returned more than half of the migrants, but many people stayed in Ceuta. Spanish officials said that the Moroccan government did not check the border and that Morocco did not respect the EU rules.	Nearly 8,000 people have crossed into Spain´s North African enclave of Ceuta in recent days. Around a quarter of those crossing from Morocco are minors , with many risking their lives by swimming around a breakwater to reach a beach on the European side. When interviewed, many young migrants said that they had no life prospects in their home countries. Clashes erupted near Morocco´s border as security forces tried to disperse new arrivals on Wednesday. Police and troops were deployed to the town of Fnideq to block access to the border. Spain´s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Ceuta to assess the situation, and he said that the lack of border control from the Moroccan government disrespected the EU. Spanish authorities said that more than half of the migrants had been returned; however, thousands remained in the enclave with their future uncertain.

Movies and video games are very different in the past. However, they are becoming more similar. Movies and video games do some things in the same ways. They both use motion capture. Motion capture is a special technique . In the past, it is usual only for movies. An actor moves. A camera records him. He changes into a character in a computer. Both movies and video games also like to tell a story. Cut scenes are in video games. A cut scene is a short scene . It tells a story. Players cannot skip this part of the game. They must watch it. Some people do not like this. They think that games must be interactive . This makes games different from movies.	In the past, movies and video games were two very different things. However, they are becoming more and more similar. Both movies and video games use some similar techniques , such as motion capture. In this technique, a computer records how an actor moves and translates him into a digital character. Video games are improving this technique to make digital characters seem more realistic . Also, movies and video games focus a lot on telling a story. It was usual only for movies; however, game designers have started to like it too. They use scenes that look like short movies, and they are not interactive . Many people feel that the main idea of video games is that they are interactive, and they are not happy that video games look more and more like movies.	As video games have become more realistic, and as movies have more computer graphics, the two industries have started to converge on each other. Motion capture, the process of changing an actor´s movements and expressions onto a digital avatar , has become a common technique for movies and games alike, and video games are still continuing to advance this technology. However, it is not just about technology. Video games and movies are becoming more intertwined when it comes to narratives or stories as well. Most games are still using non-interactive cut scenes to tell their stories. Games are supposed to be interactive, so you can usually choose where you want your character to go and what you want him to do. However, this freedom does not match with what designers want, as they want to tell a story. Several games´ critics feel that games force players to participate in a story, which robs them of their action to choose.
There is a big meeting in the Vatican. It is a meeting of Catholics. The pope is there, too. He makes a husband and wife saints . He makes them saints in one day. This is the first time in history. The couple lived in France. They lived in the 19th century. They had five daughters. All of them were nuns .	A husband and wife became saints on the same day for the first time in history. They were canonised by the pope at a synod in the Vatican. The couple lived in France in the 19th century and were the parents of five daughters. All of the daughters later became nuns . The most respected one is Saint Therese of Lisieux. The synod is focused on how the church can be a better minister to modern families, including gay Catholics.	Today for the first time in history, a husband and wife became saints on the same day. Pope Francis presided  over the canonisation ceremony at the Vatican of Louis and Azélie-Marie. The couple lived in France in the 19th century and were the parents of five daughters who all became nuns, including the much venerated Saint Therese of Lisieux. The pope praised the couple for highlighting the key role parents play in the spiritual and human upbringing of their children. “The holy spouses, Louis Martin and Marie-Azélie Guérin, practised Christian service in the family, creating day by day, an environment of love which nurtured the vocations of their daughters, among whom was Saint Therese of the Child Jesus.” The couple were canonised alongside priest Vincenzo Grossi who died in 1917, and María Isabel Salvat Romero, a 20th century Spanish nun. The canonisation comes at a time when the synod is focusing on how the church can be a better minister to modern families, including gay Catholics in same-sex unions, and re-married divorced Catholics.

The Tesla company makes semi-automated cars. This means that a special software helps the driver drive the car. Tesla has plans to make a fully automated car this year. A fully automated car can move without a driver. An accident happens last week. It happens in Texas, US. A Tesla car crashes into a tree. It starts to burn. Firefighters stop the fire. They see that there is no driver. A man sits next to the driver. Another man sits in the back. Both men die in the accident. More Tesla car accidents happen recently . Officials want to check Tesla´s cars carefully. It can be a problem for Tesla´s plans for the new software. Tesla´s CEO , Elon Musk, is confident . He believes that the new software will be good.	One week ago, a semi-automated Tesla car crashed into a tree in Texas, US. Local media said that the car was going very fast and it went off the road. It crashed into a tree and it started to burn. Firefighters extinguished the fire, and it was clear that there was no driver in the car. One man was sitting in the front passenger seat , and one man was sitting in the back of the car. Both men died in the accident. There were more accidents of Tesla cars recently. Tesla´s CEO, Elon Musk, said in January that he planned to make a new software. This software would drive the car itself, without any help of the driver. These recent accidents could change Musk´s plans.	A week ago, two men died after a Tesla vehicle, that was believed to be operating driverless, crashed into a tree in Texas, US. According to local media, the 2019 Tesla model S was moving at a high speed when it failed to round a curve, speeding off the roadway, crashing into a tree, and bursting into flames. After the fire was extinguished, authorities found one occupant in the front passenger seat and one in the back. The crash came amid growing scrutiny over Tesla´s semi-automated driving system, following several recent accidents. In March, the US Auto Safety Agency said that it had opened over 25 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles. The latest accidents could throw a wrench in Tesla´s plans to launch its updated full self-driving software to more customers. In January, Tesla´s CEO, Elon Musk, said that he was confident the car would be able to drive itself this year.
HIV is a virus. In 2016, around 1.1 million people in the USA have it. The HIV turns into AIDS if they do nothing. They can get pills if they go to a doctor. The pills can stop the HIV. You do not get AIDS if you take the pills. However, you must keep taking the pills. You cannot get completely OK. Scientists are working on a cure . They make a big step forward . They use a new method. They try it on mice. They cure nine out of 21 mice.	Scientists from the USA made an important breakthrough in treating AIDS. They used special technology which can edit the genes , and they removed the HIV virus in nine out of 21 mice. Now, the scientists are testing the method on primates (animals like big monkeys), and they want to try the method with people in 2020. Around 1.1 million people had HIV in the USA in 2016. Right now, people can take pills which stop HIV so they do not get AIDS. However, this does not make them healthy and they must keep taking the pills.	Researchers from Temple University and the University of Nebraska Medical Center said that they erased the HIV DNA from mice. In a new study published last Tuesday, the scientists used CRISPR gene-editing technology and a treatment called LASER ART to eliminate the virus. They were able to remove the virus in nine of the 21 mice that they tested the CRISPR-LASER ART method on. The scientists are now testing the method on primates. At the end of 2016, an estimated 1.1 million people had HIV in the USA, according to recent numbers from the CDC . HIV is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system and if not treated, can turn into AIDS, which severely weakens the immune system, increasing risks of more infections and diseases. The current available treatment is antiretroviral therapy, which stops HIV from replicating and prevents patients from developing AIDS. However, the patients are not cured and they must keep taking the pills to not get sick. The researchers hope to get an approval for a clinical trial with humans by mid-2020.
A big hole opens in Mexico. The hole is near a house. It is dangerous. The hole is 60 meters wide. The hole is 20 meters deep. Water is inside the hole. The family from the house is evacuated . Nobody is injured . People must stay away from the area. The hole is five meters wide when it opens. Then it grows fast. Now, people want to study why the hole is there. The study can be 30 days long.	A huge hole opened in farmers’ fields in central Mexico . The hole is 60 meters wide. It is very close to a house. The hole is about 20 meters deep, and it is filled with water. The family which lives close to the hole was evacuated. No one was injured, but the governor warned local residents to stay away from the area. The hole measured five meters when it first appeared , and then it grew quickly in just a few hours. People will now investigate why the hole appeared. People will study the soil . The investigation can take 30 days.	A huge sinkhole about 60 meters in diameter has appeared in farmers’ fields in central Mexico , threatening to swallow a nearby house. The sinkhole is around 20 meters deep. It is filled with water that is constantly moving around. The family that lives close to the sinkhole has been evacuated. No one has been injured so far, but the governor warned local residents to stay away from the area. The sinkhole measured five meters in diameter when it first appeared then grew quickly in just a few hours. The reason for the sinkhole might be the extraction of water from the ground, which softens the soil in lower levels. Officials will now carry out an investigation into what happened. This process includes soil studies, and it could take up to 30 days.
Experts in Europe make a space plane. They are going to send it into space. It has no wings . It is important. People want to use it many times. It will study re-entry . It is going to fly without people. It will fly for 100 minutes. It will fly 450 kilometres into the air. Then it will fall. It will get information. It will fall in the ocean. A ship will pick it up.	Scientists in Europe are going to send up a space plane without wings. The space plane is special because people want to use it to help them learn more about re-entry . They are going to send it without people on a flight for 100 minutes. It will fly 450 kilometres up into the atmosphere . Then it will fall back to Earth and get information on the re-entry. After that, it will use a parachute to land in the Pacific Ocean. A ship will come pick it up to get more information.	The European Space Agency is getting ready to launch its first wingless space plane on Wednesday. This test flight is the most crucial yet for the 16 foot 2 ton wingless space plane, which could help pave the way for reusable spacecraft, as it will be blasted into space and then re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere. Re-entry is a massive challenge for the aerospace industry, and it’s important because Europe currently has no atmospheric re-entry system of its own. IXV is currently scheduled to be launched into space on the Vega Rocket, from a space pad in France, for the 100 minute long unmanned mission. If all goes to plan, at about 18 minutes into the flight, the IXV will separate and reach a height of about 450 kilometres before falling and catching valuable data along the way. A parachute will then be deployed and the space plane should land in the Pacific Ocean, where it will be recovered by a ship for analysis .

Two Korean automakers, Hyundai and Kia, responded to intense speculation about the potential new product by Apple. Both companies confirmed that they weren´t in talks with Apple to develop an autonomous vehicle. Sales of electric vehicles are booming in Europe, reaching a record high in 2020. According to forecasts, by 2050, around 65% of all passenger-vehicle kilometers traveled will be electric, and there will be around 800 million electric vehicles out of a total 1.5 billion.

This news is from Bolivia. River turtles are endangered there. People catch them. They want their meat and eggs. The government helps the turtles. The government releases 100,000 turtles into a river. The turtles are very small now, but they will grow. They can be one metre long, 70 kilograms heavy and they can live up to 100 years. The turtles are important to the rivers. They clean the rivers.	The Bolivian government released more than 100,000 baby turtles into a river in Bolivia. The goal is to repopulate the area with turtles. The turtles are small now, but they can grow up to one metre in length. They can weigh up to 70 kilograms and live up to 100 years. The turtles are endangered because of the high demand for their meat and eggs which are high in protein. The turtles play an important role in the river ecosystem. They clean the rivers by digesting food.	More than 100,000 of these baby turtles have been released into a river near the Bolivian Amazon. Bolivia’s President, Evo Morales, along with Alexandra Moreira, Bolivian Minister for the Environment and Water, attended the releasing ceremony. The goal is to repopulate the area with the small turtles. These can eventually measure up to 3.2 feet (1 metre), weigh up to 154 pounds (70 kilograms) and live for up to 100 years. The repopulation plan dates from 2007 and has the support of Brazil . According to Moreira since they started, 10 million baby turtles have been released back into the wild near the border with Brazil. River turtles inhabiting the rivers of the Bolivian Amazon are endangered  due to the high demand for their meat and eggs which are high in protein. Morales praised conservation work being carried out for the turtles, pointing out how more than ever there are new generations joining political projects that allow us to take care of Mother Earth. The president of the ecological association in the area, Jose Suarez from Brazil, said conservation work was important for the biodiversity in the region. He pointed out that turtles have no nationality. They belong to nature and it is imperative , therefore , that projects like this are undertaken. The turtles live in the rivers of the Departments of La Paz, Pando, and Santa Cruz. They play an important role in the ecosystem there, as they help to save flooded forests by digesting food which can clean the rivers.
The astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir are going on a spacewalk on Friday. It is the first time for Koch and the 4th time for Meir. They must change bad battery parts on the space station. This is the first time that two women go to space alone with no men. In March, NASA wants to send two women to spacewalk. However, there are some problems with the spacesuits. A man goes for one of the women. People do not like this change of plans. Before this, there are 200 space walks at the space station. Only 14 women go on a spacewalk and never unaccompanied.	NASA astronauts, Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, made history on Friday morning, as they were the first women to go on a spacewalk without men. It was Jessica’s first and Christina’s 4th time going on a spacewalk. Their mission was to replace battery parts on the International Space Station which were not functioning properly. In March, NASA decided to send two women to spacewalk, but there was a problem with the prepared spacesuits . They would not fit Koch and another astronaut, Anne McClain, so Nick Hague, took McClain’s place. People had negative reactions to this change. Before this mission, only 14 women went on a spacewalk, and men were always with them.	“Jessica and Christina, we are proud of you. See you when you get home.” With these words, NASA wished good luck to their female astronauts, Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, on their first spacewalk on Friday. It was the first time for Jessica and the 4th time for Christina, but their first time without men. Their journey outside the International Space Station began at 6:38 a.m. Central Time. Their mission was to replace a faulty battery unit on the International Space Station. NASA’s decided to schedule an all-female spacewalk in March, but they changed ideas. There were not enough spacesuits to fit Koch and another astronaut, Anne McClain, so astronaut Nick Hague took McClain’s place. This change had negative feedback on social media. Friday’s spacewalk was an important event. There have been more than 200 spacewalks for the International Space Station, but only 14 women have been on a spacewalk, and never without men.

There is a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan. An earthquake hits the plant in 2011. There is a tsunami, too. Both of these are big problems. Toxic water is coming out of the power plant. People are keeping it in big tanks . There are 1,000 large tanks right now. They hold more than 1 million tons of water. However, there is going to be more and more toxic water. People want to build more tanks. There will be no room for new tanks by 2022. People are thinking about what to do. Some experts say that they can let the water out into the ocean. Other people do not like this idea.	In 2011, an earthquake and a tsunami struck the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Both events badly damaged three reactors, and toxic water started leaking from the reactors. People are keeping the toxic water in 1,000 large tanks which hold more than 1 million tons of water. They have plans to build even more tanks, but there will be no more room for the tanks by 2022. One Japanese minister said that one option is to let the toxic water go into the sea. Critics say that this will be very bad for fishing and farming. One German specialist says that the only option is to keep the water in tanks. Other experts say that the water must be let out into the ocean. Nothing is official yet. We will have to wait and see what the Japanese government decides to do.	In 2011, a disaster struck the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant when an earthquake and a tsunami caused meltdowns of three of its reactors. Water which used to keep the reactor cores from melting , leaked and mixed with rain and groundwater. As reported before, people stored the toxic water in 1,000 large tanks, which hold more than 1 million tons of water. However, even with plans to build even more tanks, room is expected to run out by mid-2022. Last Tuesday, Japan’s environmental minister said in a press conference that the only option will be to drain the water into the sea. Critics say that this would ruin Fukushima’s fishing and agriculture. Even 8 years after the disaster, 22 countries and regions still have import restrictions for goods from the area around Fukushima. A number of nuclear scientists say that releasing the water into the ocean is the only realistic option, while a German Greenpeace nuclear specialist says that the only acceptable option is storing the toxic water. Nothing is official yet, and time will show how the Japanese government is going to solve the problem.
In March, thousands of sea turtles come to a beach in eastern India. They lay eggs in the sand. One and a half months later, the small baby turtles come out from the sand.

One and a half months later, the small baby turtles started to come out from the sand. They knew where the sea was, and they started to move towards it. This was a dangerous journey, and not all turtles completed it. In the past, people killed Olive Ridley turtles for meat and leather . Now, there are official limits that tell how many turtles people can kill. However, some people do not respect the limits.	Thousands of baby Olive Ridley turtles have hatched on a beach in eastern India. The name for the sea turtle is tied to the color of its shell, an olive-green shade. It is the smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles, and it lives in the tropical areas of the South Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. In late March, the turtles settled in the Gahirmatha beach to lay eggs in the sand. Between the fifth and eighth of May, the tiny hatchlings began to come out from the sand and are now making their journey towards the sea. Olive Ridley turtles were once killed for meat and leather. Legal quotas have reduced the number of killed animals; however, an illegal industry with their eggs still exists.

Poachers in Africa kill rhinos. They sell their horns . People in Asia buy them. They believe that rhino horns will make them live longer. Some rich people also feel more special when they buy rhino horns. Rhino horns are very expensive. One kilo costs tens of thousands of dollars. Researchers have an interesting idea. They make rhino horns radioactive . Researchers believe that people will not want to buy something radioactive. It will be easier to catch people who take rhino horns out from Africa. Some ports and airports have special monitors. They find radioactive things. It is good news for African rhinos.	Researchers in South Africa are testing a new method to stop the illegal killing of rhinos. Poachers kill rhinos for their horns which are important mainly for people in Asia. They believe that rhino horns will make them live longer. Also, rich people buy rhino horns because they want to have something that people cannot normally buy. The price of one kilogram of rhino horns can be tens of thousands of dollars. Researchers find a way on how to make rhino horns less attractive. They put a radioactive material into the horns. Researchers hope that people will not want to buy something radioactive. Also, it will be easier to track smugglers . Some ports, airports, and border crossings use special monitors which can find radioactive material.	Researchers in South Africa are working on a potentially new method to deter rhino poachers and smugglers. James Larkin, one of the project´s main researchers, said that he hoped to establish a reduction in poaching. He said that researchers wanted to do it by injecting a small quantity of radioactive isotope into the horns of rhinos. This method will have two effects. Firstly, it´ll devalue the rhino horn in the eyes of end users who´re going to be less likely to want to own something radioactive. Secondly, making the horn radioactive will make it a lot easier to track it when smugglers move it across international borders as there are about 11,000 radiation monitors at various ports, airports, and border crossings. Rhino horns can be worth tens of thousands of dollars per kilo, and demand is mainly in Asia where some people believe that rhino horns have medicinal properties, and they act as a symbol of wealth.

On Tuesday, police released video footage showing the alleged abductor walking hand-in-hand with Mohamed away from the offices. A police spokesman told a news conference that they’d received a tip-off from the suspect’s mother on Thursday, after he told her he was involved in Mohamed’s abduction. When the suspect turned up at his mother’s house, he was arrested, and officers say he immediately declared that the body of the child was in his vehicle. Police are still waiting for the results of an autopsy to confirm the child’s identity as well as clarify the circumstances around his death, including when he may have died. Investigators also said there were no indications that the suspect, who’s from the East German state of Brandenburg, had links to the right-wing scene or had any contact with xenophobic circles.

Around 10% of people in Sri Lanka are Muslims . Some Muslim women wear burqas. A burqa covers the face and body. More women in Sri Lanka start to wear burqas. It is a problem for the government. The government bans burqas. All children between 5 and 16 years must go to school there. Some schools in Sri Lanka do not keep the government´s rules. They are schools for Muslims. The government wants to close more than 1,000 schools for Muslims. Last year, the government makes a new rule. People who die from COVID-19 must have cremation . It is a problem for Muslims. They do not usually do it. Some countries are not happy with this rule. The Sri Lanka government changes it again.	The Sri Lankan government will ban wearing burqas , and it will close some Islamic schools. Children in Sri Lanka must go to school from the age of 5 and they must study until the age of 16. Schools must keep some rules, but many Islamic schools do not do this, and the government decided to close more than a thousand of them. In the past, women in Sri Lanka did not wear burqas. Recently, some of them started, and the government thought that it was dangerous for the country. Last year, the government decided to cremate people who died from COVID-19. Muslims were not happy because it was not usual for them to cremate dead people. This year, the government changed the rule, but there are some new strict rules for Muslims in Sri Lanka.	Sri Lanka will ban the wearing of burqas , and the country will shut down more than a thousand Islamic schools. Children from the ages of 5 to 16 years must study in accordance with the national education policy; therefore, schools that do not adhere to it will be closed soon. It´s the latest move from the government that will affect the country´s minority Muslim population. According to the Secretary Minister for Security, wearing burqas affected national security directly. Muslim women and girls never used to wear burqas; however, recently they came about, which the government considered to be a sign of religious extremism. The move on burqas and schools follows last year´s order to cremate COVID-19 victims against the wishes of Muslims who bury their dead. The ban was lifted earlier this year after criticism from the US and international rights groups.
A pony walks into a police building. It happens in England. A security camera captures the moment. An officer tries to make the pony leave. It doesn’t care . It leaves later when it wants to.	A security camera captured the moment a pony walked into a police building in England. That is certainly not something you see every day. An officer tried to make the pony leave, but it didn’t pay much attention to him. It later left on its own.	Now, this is certainly not something you see every day. Yeah, staff at a Cheshire police station had a bit of a shock when a horse walked into the force’s headquarters in Winsford. CCTV captured an officer attempting to get the pony off the premises , but the small horse appeared to be determined to hand itself in . The spokesman added, “We like to ensure a warm welcome to all our guests at HQ and at neigh  point” – ha, that’s funny – “did the horse pose a risk to security.”
Researchers at the University of Albany in the USA study patients with COVID-19. These patients get a special drug. Doctors usually use this drug to treat people with malaria. Malaria is a sickness that people get from insects. In the past, the US president, Donald Trump, says that the drug could be good for COVID-19 patients, too. In March, officials make it possible to use the drug in hospitals. Researchers study 1,400 patients. They get the drug. However, they do not feel better. It seems that the drug does not help them. The result of the study is not official. There are no random people in the study. There must be another study. It must follow official rules.	Researchers at the University of Albany in the USA studied patients who had COVID-19, and they got the drug hydroxychloroquine. Researchers found out that the drug did not help COVID-19 patients get better. Hydroxychloroquine is a drug against the sickness malaria; however, the US president, Donald Trump, repeatedly said that the drug could help COVID-19 patients. In March, US authorities allowed medical workers to use the drug. Researchers studied the cases of more than 1,400 COVID-19 patients who got the drug. These patients did not get better or worse than patients who did not get it. The results of the study do not prove the effects of the drug because the study did not include random people but only COVID-19 patients. The study needed random people to truly know if the drug helps people or not.	A new study conducted by researchers at the University of Albany found that patients, who were hospitalized in the New York area, did not benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine is the anti-malaria drug which the US president, Donald Trump, repeatedly praised as a possible treatment for the coronavirus. In March, US authorities issued an emergency use authorization to let medical workers use the drug on certain COVID-19 patients. Researchers looked at more than 1,400 COVID-19 patients, and they found that the patients, who received hydroxychloroquine, did not get better or worse than the patients who did not receive it. The study is not considered conclusive because it did not fulfill all necessary criteria . The state of New York is currently conducting a randomized controlled trial on the drug.

People launch a rocket. They launch it from Kazakhstan. It is a Russian rocket. It carries two probes into space. The probes are European. This is the ExoMars mission. The European Space Agency organises it. The probes are going to Mars. That takes seven months. When they are close to Mars, the probes separate . One probe goes down to Mars. The other one moves around the planet. It gets information about the atmosphere.	People launched a rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Russian rocket carried up two robotic probes which will travel to Mars. This is the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission. If all goes to plan, the journey to Mars should take seven months – the probes will reach the planet in October. When they get close to the Red Planet, they will separate . One probe will land on Mars and the other will orbit around the planet. It will collect information about the atmosphere. Scientists are especially interested in the methane gas there because this is a sign of life.	Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. A Proton rocket stands ready for launch . Inside, two robotic probes  destined for the Red Planet. Together they make up the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission. The rocket will launch at 3:31 p.m. local time on Monday or 9:31 a.m. GMT . Around 10 hours later, the rocket will separate and the probes will continue their journey towards Mars. If all goes to plan, that journey should take seven months, reaching the planet in October. Three days out from the edge of the Martian atmosphere, the two probes will separate. An entry , descent and landing demonstrator module known as Schiaparelli will drop towards the surface. There, it will test technology for future missions and make environmental observations for a short period of time before its batteries die. The Trace Gas Orbiter, meanwhile, will enter the planet’s orbit, spending a year making manoeuvres to lower its altitude to 400 kilometres. By December 2017, it will be ready to begin analysing the make-up of the Martian atmosphere. In particular, scientists want to understand the presence of methane gas, a sign that life may once have existed on the Red Planet.
A group of scientists from all over the world have some news about a COVID-19 booster vaccine. A booster vaccine is a vaccine which makes a previous vaccine stronger. A vaccine is a medicine that stops you from getting sick. Some scientists believe that the booster vaccine is important. It protects people from the coronavirus. Then, the latest study says that older COVID-19 vaccines work well. They protect people enough . A problem is that rich countries buy booster vaccines. Companies cannot make enough vaccines for other countries. Countries must think about other people. They must remember that people in other countries need vaccines, too.	A group of scientists from all over the world said that COVID-19 vaccines worked well. It was not necessary to use booster vaccines . Many people already argue that it is not necessary to use booster vaccines, and the news will make the argument even more interesting. Scientists used data from many studies and tests. They said that countries should keep vaccinating people who did not get a vaccine yet instead of giving booster vaccines to people who already were vaccinated. Another problem was that if rich countries use booster vaccines, companies will not have enough capacity to make the other vaccines, too. This is important that countries started to think globally and did not focus on only their own problems.	A panel of scientists from around the world said in a review that COVID-19 vaccines worked so well that most people don´t need a booster . Scientists based their information on a wide range of real-world observational studies as well as data from clinical trials . All of this is likely to add to a debate over whether to use booster vaccines at all. Experts said that governments should focus on immunizing the unvaccinated and wait for more data on which boosters are most effective and at what levels. The WHO said that wealthier countries offering booster shots increases the risk of variants appearing elsewhere. This is because if the rich countries take booster shots and introduce regular booster shots for the current viruses, then they will use up all the capacity of vaccine companies. There will be no or minimal vaccines available for the rest of the world. Therefore, it´s necessary to push national priorities to the side for global needs.

It’s thought that the man took a taxi to the bridge before he proceeded to climb the iconic Sydney landmark. Although his actions don’t appear to have any malicious intent, the incident led to the closure of three lanes and brought traffic to a standstill, which morning commuters no doubt didn’t appreciate, as the event unfolded between 9 and 11 a.m. Just before 11 a.m., the man climbed back down from his spot, where he was arrested by police. It’s thought that he’s been taken to the Royal North Shore Hospital for assessment. Lanes have since been reopened and traffic in the area has resumed to normal.

At the bottom of the ocean, sometimes there are vents . The rocks and water around these vents are hot. Scientists find octopuses near one vent. There are hundreds of them. They are females . They put their eggs near the vent. This is very unusual. This place is not good for the octopuses. It is not good for the eggs, either .	Experts discovered hundreds of octopuses near a deep-sea vent off the coast of Costa Rica. The female octopuses are nursing their eggs there. This genus of octopuses are typically loners, so it was surprising to see them grouped together. Moreover, the hot rocks and water near the vent is not a good place for the eggs. An expert from a museum in Chicago does not believe that the baby octopuses can survive. Scientists do not know why the mother octopuses laid their eggs near the vent.	Deep-sea expeditions discovered hundreds of octopuses nursing their eggs near a deep-sea vent off the coast of Costa Rica. The species has not been identified but its genus is Muuscoctopus. Octopuses in this group are typically loners, so it was surprising to see them grouped together. The location for laying their eggs near the vent is less than ideal, and Janet Voight from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago does not believe that the baby octopuses could survive. It is likely that the females were forced to lay their eggs there because they are the surplus population, or the fissures had not had been as active.

The bombs explode. Four tower blocks are gone. Two blocks are too strong. The bombs do not destroy them completely.	In the mid-1960s in Glasgow, people built six tower blocks . They were the tallest residential buildings in Europe, and they provided housing for almost 5,000 people. The buildings solved the city’s housing problems, but they became rundown and vandalised. All six of the tower blocks were going to be brought down in a single demolition, but two of them were too strong – part of them survived the explosion.	A controlled explosion was meant to bring down six tower blocks in Glasgow. However, two of the Red Road Flat buildings proved to be a greater pillar of strength than expected. About 2,500 residents from nearby properties were kept outside the exclusion zone until safety checks were made. But shortly before nightfall, they were allowed to return to their homes. Glasgow Housing Association said no new exclusion zone was planned for Monday. The flats were built in the mid-1960s to tackle the city’s housing crisis. Once the tallest residential structures in Europe, they provided accommodation for almost 5,000 people. When first built, they were considered the answer to the city’s housing problem but became rundown and vandalised. Officials said the decision to take all six blocks down in one single demolition was made following feedback from local residents. The organisation said it will be holding consultations on development options for the site, so it remains to be seen what Glasgow’s skyline will look like once the dust has  settled .

There are some problems with Facebook. One problem is privacy . There are breaches in privacy. Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of Facebook. He comes to Congress . Senators ask him about Facebook. He answers. They talk for two days. Zuckerberg also says ‘sorry’ for the problems with privacy.	Mark Zuckerberg spent two days at Congress last week where he answered the senators’ questions about Facebook. He also said ‘sorry’ for privacy breaches on Facebook. One senator asked Zuckerberg if he could say the name of the hotel where he was staying. This shocked the Facebook boss and he took around 7 seconds to answer no, and the senator asked this to demonstrate the problem of privacy.	Mark Zuckerberg took two days to testify before members of Congress last week, and he apologised for privacy breaches on Facebook. He said that the social media website did not take a broad enough view of its responsibility, which was a big mistake. He continued to take responsibility for Facebook, saying that he started it, runs it, and he is responsible for what happens at the company. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin asked Zuckerberg whether he would be comfortable sharing the name of the hotel where he stayed the previous night, or the names of the people who he messaged that week. The CEO was startled by the question, and he took about 7 seconds to respond with no. The senator used such techniques to illustrate the point of the hearing – people’s right to privacy, limits of the rights to privacy, and how much we give up in the name of ‘connecting people around the world’.
Do you have a feeling that this winter is very cold? Think about the people who live in one Russian town. They say that they live in the coldest town on Earth. The name of their town is Oymyakon. The town is in Siberia. The temperatures very often go down to minus 60. The people say that these low temperatures last sometimes for ten days. There is another special thing in their town.

The hat which French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte wore during the Battle of Waterloo is on its way back to the battlefield which saw his demise . The two-cornered, or bicorne hat, is normally kept in a museum in Sens in east of Paris. It was the one Napoleon wore on June 18th, 1815 when he was defeated by the British forces commanded by the Duke of Wellington and General Von Blücher’s Prussian army. Specialised transporters prepared tailor-made boxes to take the precious hat to Wellington Museum in the Belgian town of Waterloo where it will stay for four months. “This one is the last one he wore because it’s the one he had during the Battle of Waterloo. And, as it was a rainy day, it changed its shape and you can still see traces on the front of raindrops which tell us about the rain which was falling from the Belgian sky.” One of the emperor’s uniforms was also sent to Waterloo ahead of the bicentenary commemorations. Napoleon, initially defeated in 1813, had escaped exile in the Mediterranean island of Elba and returned to power for a period now called the Hundred Days. After Waterloo, he was confined on the Atlantic island of Saint Helena until his death in 1821.
This news is from Ecuador. An earthquake hits in April. It kills 650 people. 29,000 Ecuadoreans are homeless. The earthquake damages the infrastructure . Two more earthquakes hit this month. They are not as bad, however. Only one person dies. Someone films the streets when the earthquakes hit. People are scared. They run in the streets.

Traffic came to a standstill .	Captured on camera – footage of an earthquake in Ecuador showing people scrambling on the streets as the ground beneath them shakes. Two quakes struck the South American country, resulting in one death and light damage in the same region where a magnitude 7.8 tremor killed more than 650 just last month. In comparison, these tremors measured 6.7 and 6.8 in magnitude according to the US geological survey. Visibly distressed, the footage shows Ecuadoreans in commotion and traffic stopping to a standstill. Unlike the devastating earthquake in April, this tremor only caused light injuries and one fatality for which the cause remains unclear. The tremors caused minor damage, mainly hitting infrastructure that had already been destroyed in the April disaster, which made nearly 29,000 Ecuadoreans homeless and claimed the lives of many. The fearful reaction seen in the footage shows the continued effects of the last earthquake on the people of Ecuador.

This baby hippo has been getting to know her new  digs at the San Diego Zoo. Devi, a curious eight-week old hippopotamus calf , got familiar with her new surroundings after stepping out for the first time this week. Along with her mother, she made quite a splash in the hippo pool where she’ll be hanging out four days a week. And it wasn’t just the zoogoers that had something cool to look at. Devi herself was likely equally amused by the people staring at her through the glass. “Hippos have a membrane over their eyes that allows them to see us outside the exhibit much like we can see them through the glass.” Over the last few weeks, Devi’s grown stronger and more curious, venturing to the farthest reaches and deeper parts of the pool. But wherever she goes, her mother is always just a few feet away, nosing the calf back toward the shore where she’s kept protected. The calf’s father was recently taken off exhibit and will remain in a separate area for the time being , giving mom and baby some precious splash-filled bonding time.

Australian scientists make a new diabetes test. A diabetes test checks the level of blood sugar in the body. Blood sugar gives you energy. The scientists believe that their test is very special. It looks like a strip. The test does not hurt. It checks the blood sugar from saliva . An enzyme is inside the strip. The enzyme turns the blood sugar into a signal. A special device reads the signal. This way to test is different from any other tests. The test does not use any electronic devices. It uses ink. It means that it is easy to make the test. People can print it. It is fast and cheap.	Australian scientists developed a new diabetes test that finds glucose in saliva . They believed that it was very exciting, and it was something that people hoped to make for a long time. Scientists put an enzyme into a strip, and this enzyme turns glucose into a signal. A special device can read the signal, and it shows the level of glucose in the body. Scientists said that this test would change the way of making medical tests. It is very easy and cheap to make the test because people can print it. There is no electronic device in it, and it contains only ink. The test is non-invasive, which means that it is not painful.	Australian scientists say that they´ve developed the ´ holy grail ´ of blood sugar testing for diabetics. A non-invasive strip checks glucose levels through saliva. Scientists have developed a way of embedding an enzyme that detects glucose directly into a transistor, which is a very sensitive amplifier . The enzyme turns glucose into a signal that the transistor can detect. The transistor can be manufactured at a low cost using simple printing techniques because the electronic materials are all inks. Scientists believe that this test is going to radically change the way we think about medical devices and sensors in particular. At the moment, the test is going to start clinical trials before it can be manufactured at a large scale.
This news is about a woman. She is from Peru. She is 22 years old. She has a tumour in her body. Her tumour grows for eight years. It gets 50 centimetres long and 16 kilograms heavy. It makes the woman look pregnant . It makes her life difficult. She cannot work or study. She can only stay at home. Doctors operate on the woman. They remove the tumour. Everything goes fine. She is going to be OK.	This news is about a woman from Peru. When she was 14, a tumour started to grow in her ovaries . It grew for eight years – until her age of 22. Now, doctors removed the tumour. It was sixteen kilograms heavy and 50 centimetres large. It made her look pregnant . The woman talked about her life with the tumour. She couldn’t work or study. The tumour made her breathing difficult. She could only stay at home where she took care of her nieces and nephews. The operation was successful and the woman is going to be fine.	A woman in Peru has had a sixteen-kilogram tumour removed from her abdomen . The tumour , which reportedly grew inside her body for more than eight years, gave her the appearance of being pregnant. But the 22-year-old patient, identified as Irianita Rojas Rasma, was not carrying a child. Doctors say the tumour originated in the patient’s ovaries and grew to approximatively 50 centimetres or 20 inches in diametre . The growth was impeding the patient’s breathing and was surgically removed last weekend. She said, “I couldn’t work or study with the tumour. I just stayed at home. I dedicated myself to taking care of my nieces and nephews. I stayed at home. It was the only thing I could do.” Thankfully, the operation was a success and Rojas is expected to make a full recovery. Medical experts at the national hospital in Lima are now said to be running tests on the massive tumour.
Reading Festival happens last weekend. It is one of the biggest music festivals in England. Thousands of people visit it every year. Around 100,000 people visit the festival this year. When they leave, the fields are full of rubbish . There are plastic cups, underwear, and other things. Also there are empty tents. The tents are a big problem. It is not possible to recycle them. They end up in landfills where they stay 100,000 years. A report says that people in the UK leave around 250,000 tents every year. Many shops sell tents as single-use items. Single-use means that people use them only once and then throw them away.	Reading Festival is one of England´s biggest music festivals, and thousands of people visit it every year. Last year, organizers canceled the festival because of the coronavirus, which meant that this year, even more people came. Around 100,000 festival goers went to Reading last weekend, and they left tons of rubbish in the fields. There were mostly empty tents, plastic cups, underwear, and condoms . The most difficult things to recycle are the tents, which usually go to landfills , and they take up to 10,000 years to decompose . A report says that in the UK, people leave behind around 250,000 tents every year. The problem is that shops sell tents as items you use one time, so people do not think that they could use them more than once. In 2019, people from Reading saved around 300 tents which they then used themselves.	Reading Festival came to an end; however, its environmental footprint is far from gone. Around 100,000 people came to one of England´s biggest music festivals after the cancellation of last year´s event, and they´ve not only left the event, but left tons of plastic waste, including abandoned tents, used underwear, and condoms. Empty tents and litter were all over several fields in Reading, a day after the festival ended. The discarded plastic tents could reportedly take up to 10,000 years to fully decompose in landfill, adding to the tons of other waste made by festival goers. The Association of Independent Festivals launched an initiative , calling for supermarkets and retailers to stop selling tents as single-use items. According to the association, around 250,000 tents are left at music festivals across the UK every year. Unfortunately, tents are one of the worst things to recycle. In some cases, they go to charity. However, the ultimate message for festival goers is take their tent home. At the last event in 2019, more than 300 tents were saved and given to people in Reading.

This news is from England. A woman comes to work. She wears flat shoes. Her bosses do not like that. They want high heels . They fire the woman. She is very upset. She starts a petition . 30,000 people sign the petition.	Bosses fired a woman from England for turning up to work wearing flat shoes. She started a petition, which 30,000 people already signed. The woman said that she was very upset. She said that high heels can damage the body, and that there is a sexual element to them. She said that there is not such a problem with a shirt and tie for a man. She added that also, this is not just about heels, but a women’s rights issue .	“I can’t believe it! I’m going to push for the 100,000 and then some, so that we can get this brought up in Parliament, cause as I said, it’s not just about heels, this is a women’s rights issue.” A government petition, its numbers continuing to rise high – all because of high heels. Nicola Thorp was fired for turning up to work wearing flat shoes. “I was so upset. And there’s this horrible contradiction in your head between, actually, it’s a small deal: wear the heels, earn money – but there’s such a bigger issue and you’re conflicted because I have a rent to pay, I had bills to pay, but I also wanted to keep, you know, my integrity .” Described as baffling by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and an example of outdated sexism, Nicola’s job security rested flat out on replacing her flat shoes with heels between 2 and 4 inches. “There is an argument that says that if a woman is forced to wear something which makes her feel uncomfortable or inhibits the way in which she can carry out her professional duties, then that could be less favourable treatment.” Employers have the discretion to supply a dress code and allow for differences between men and women, but they must abide by an equivalent level of formality. The company involved said she’d signed the appearance guidelines and knew what she was agreeing to. Some argue that heel and make-up requirements are no different to shirt and tie requirements for men. “There’s a history behind heels and the damage that it can do to women, and there’s a sexualised element to it as opposed to a shirt and tie for a man. There just is that difference and it’s steeped in a history of sexism and objectification .” The petition has accumulated nearly 30,000 figures and established its own social media presence with its hashtag “myheelsmychoice”. Nicola can stand with her head held high and her feet planted firmly on the ground .

They say that this is a big problem. They also say that the oceans are getting warmer very fast. Sea water can go up. There can be strong storms. There can be heavy rains.	In 1958, people began recording ocean temperatures. According to a new report , ocean temperatures in 2018 were the hottest ever. The authors of the report say that this is solid proof of climate change. They say that this is a big problem for everybody. The authors are the same scientists who also published another report last week. It says that oceans are getting warmer faster than people thought. This can lead to problems like rising sea levels, heavier rainfall, stronger storms, and melting polar ice.	According to a new report, ocean temperatures in 2018 were the hottest that they have been since the record keeping began in 1958. The authors of the report say that ocean heating is solid proof of climate change, and that the findings are a ‘ major concern ’ for both the scientific and global communities. The scientists are the same group of researchers who published a report last week showing that the world’s oceans are heating up faster than people previously thought. Warmer oceans can cause a number of issues , such as rising sea levels, heavier rainfall, stronger storms, and melting polar ice. In fact, another study found that Antarctica’s ice sheet has been melting over the past four decades at an alarming rate.
A team of experts work on something really cool. It is a hoverbike. Maybe, it will fly near you soon. The creator of the hoverbike can fly a helicopter. He knows that helicopters are very complex . They are also not very safe. He wants to make something better. That is why he works on the hoverbike. The team has a smaller version of it. They are testing it currently . It can fly up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph).	A dedicated team of engineers is working on something really cool. It is a hoverbike which might be flying near you soon. The creator of the hoverbike can fly a helicopter. When he got his license, he realised helicopters are very complex machines. He wanted to make a safer and less complex machine. That is how he came up with the idea of the hoverbike. His team is testing a smaller version of the hoverbike. It can fly up to 45 miles per hour (72 kph).	Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, of course not, but it is a hoverbike! Thanks to a kickstarter project and a dedicated team of engineers at UK company Malloy Aeronautics, this new hoverbike could be soaring in an airspace near you. However, this small drone is just a one-third scale version for mass production, and a full-sized one will be flown by remote and piloted by a person. “When I got my helicopter license, I realised that the helicopter as a design has a lot of improvements that need to be made, and one of them is safety and reliability. They’re very complex machines. And my goal was to see where we could strip away the complexity and increase the safety and that’s basically where the hoverbike came from.” The team first plan to launch the hoverbike as an unmanned aerial vehicle, before securing an aviation certification for a manned model. The mini hoverbike can reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour (72 kph). But don’t get your hopes up just yet. It could be a few years before we see them in our skies.
People think that pigeons are not beautiful. Many New Yorkers do not like them. They call them “rats with wings ”. One man wants to change people’s opinions . He trains 2,000 pigeons. He puts a light on each pigeon. The pigeons fly in the air. This is a beautiful show. People come to watch. They can watch the show every weekend evening until June 12th. The show takes place in Brooklyn, New York.	People do not recognize pigeons for their beauty and some New Yorkers even call them “rats with wings”, but one artist tried to change people’s opinions . He specially trained pigeons with lights on their bodies to circle the skies for 30 minutes. People turned up to watch the show, which will take place every weekend evening until June 12th in the Brooklyn navy yard in New York. Two thousand birds flew in a tight space, so some people feared that they would be pooped on by the birds. The artist explained that most animals do not poop while they are exercising, but when they are relaxed and sitting down.	Like a thousand shooting stars – it’s a city already known for its bright lights. Now New York’s been lit up by pigeons. Yeah, they’re not normally known for their beauty and some New Yorkers call them “rats with wings”, but artist Duke Riley’s tried to change people’s opinions with his Fly By Night project. “As people move into the city that I’m from the city and I’m familiar with some of these traditions, sometimes they have, you know, they’re not aware of it and, you know, and ignorant.” The pigeons are all specially trained and spent 30 minutes circling the skies above their temporary home, which is a decommissioned US navy ship, currently sat in the Brooklyn navy yard, and they were truly involved in the project. “I think it’s a collaborative project between me and the pigeons and, you know, you can ask them what their opinion is on and I don’t want to speak for them exactly. Whether it’s, you know, performance or, you know, some type of a, maybe it’s just a drawing that they’re doing in the sky, you know.” Crowds did turn up to see the first of the displays – these pigeons will be taking to the skies every weekend evening until June 12th. “As a bystander of many pigeons in my life, I like to see them so illuminated and trained.” “It’s really an incredible spectacle.” With 2,000 birds flying in such a tight space, there were some fears people would walk away with a so-called “good luck charm” on their shoulder. “You know, most animals don’t really, you know, including humans, usually don’t like to defecate while they’re exercising, they usually try to do when they’re relaxed and sitting down, you know.” Apparently, one or two people left with evidence that suggests that’s not always the case.
This news is about Fidel Castro. He starts the Cuban Revolution. He fights capitalist and colonial oppression . He turns Cuba against the USA. He turns Cuba to the Soviet Union. Now, Fidel Castro is old. He dies. Many Cubans are sad. They come to Revolution Square in Havana, Cuba to show respect. Cuba is in mourning for 9 days. The mourning stops on December 4th.	Fidel Castro died on Friday, and many Cubans came to Havana’s historic Revolution Square to show respect. People cremated Castro the following day and declared a 9-day mourning  period . Fidel Castro’s final resting place is going to be in Santiago de Cuba, the city where the revolution started. Fidel Castro spent his life fighting capitalist and colonial oppression . He turned the country towards the Soviet Union and against the USA, which tried to remove him from power. When the mourning ends on December 4th, the country will start to build a new type of relationship with the world.	Cubans gathered at Havana’s historic Revolution Square to pay homage to Fidel Castro, following the iconic leader’s death on Friday. People cremated Castro the following day and declared a 9-day period of mourning . People carried his ashes to a final resting place in Santiago de Cuba, the city in the eastern part of the country where he launched the revolution. The ceremony ended on Tuesday night when foreign leaders paid their respects to a man who dedicated his life to fighting capitalist and colonial oppression . Fidel Castro aligned his country with the Soviet Union and outlasted 9 US presidents who had sought to oust him and undermine him. When people lay his cremated ashes to rest on December 4th, the mourning period will end and Cuba will embark  on establishing what will be a very different relationship with the rest of the world.
Scientists do a study . They watch how much protected land there is. There is less and less protected land. From 1961 to 2019, there are 1.3 million square miles less of protected land. This is mostly because of industry . In the USA, there is less and less protected land, too.	A new study found out that protected land around the world is shrinking . Under President Trump, the USA saw the largest reduction in protected land ever. However, the study says that government proposed 90% of the changes since 2000. Trump is also not the first president to reduce protected land. For example, three American presidents shrank some protected land in Washington. Around the world, 1.3 million square miles were reduced since 1961. The changes are mostly because of industry.	According to a new study, protected land is shrinking around the world, and the USA under President Trump has seen its largest reduction ever. However, the study says that 90% of the government’s proposed land protection changes have been issued since 2000. Trump is also not the first president to shrink a national monument (which in the USA is a protected area similar to a national park). For example, three different presidents shrank Mount Olympus National Monument in Washington before it eventually was designated a national park. Across the globe, 1.3 million square miles of land protections have been downgraded or removed since 1961, according to the study. The changes are largely in favour of industrial operations, but local pressure and land claims are also a cause.
Peter goes to a doctor. “Doctor, I have a problem,” he says. “When I sleep in my bed, I think that there is somebody under my bed. I look under my bed and I think there is somebody on my bed.

The first calendar comes from the year 1964. Since that time, 37 photographers take the photos. The calendars are full of models who wear little clothing. Now, he photographs are more artistic . Bryan Adams is a Canadian singer. He is a photographer, too. He takes photos for Pirelli´s calendar this year. Iggy Pop, Cher, Rita Ora, and other artists are in the calendar. Adams comes to Italy last week. He tests positive for COVID-19. For that reason, he introduces the calendar virtually .	Many people know that Bryan Adams is a singer, but he is a successful photographer, too. Last week, he introduced the Italian company´s Pirelli 2022 calendar, and he shot the photographs. Unfortunately, Adams tested positive for COVID-19 when he arrived in Italy, so he unveiled the calendar virtually . For the calendar, Adams took pictures of some music stars, for example, Iggy Pop, Cher, and Rita Ora. The calendar is Pirelli´s 48th edition , and since the first edition in 1964, 37 photographers worked on the calendars. In the past, Pirelli´s calendars were usually full of models, but this started to change a few years ago, and nowadays, the photographs are more artistic. There is a limited number of calendars every year, and Pirelli usually gives them to its buyers as a gift.	Canadian rocker and photographer Bryan Adams unveiled ´On the Road´, Pirelli´s 2022 calendar starring some of the music industry’s biggest names, including Iggy Pop, Cher, Rita Ora, and Jennifer Hudson. Since 1964, the Pirelli Calendar has been created by a total of 37 photographers, and it’s featured an impressive roster of talent, such as models Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell and actors Sophia Loren and Maggie Cheung. The calendar has a limited run, and it’s usually gifted to company clients. In recent years, it’s moved away from featuring images of scantily -dressed models to more artistic themes, featuring various celebrities. The 2022 version, which was the Italian company´s 48th edition, shows a day in the life of a touring musician. As a photographer, Adams took Pictures of Mick Jagger as well as Britain’s Queen Elizabeth. He also published books of his photos, including one on injured British soldiers. However, the 62-year-old was unable to unveil his famous calendar in person in Milan because he tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival in Italy last week.
MGM is a US film studio. It starts in 1924. It has a very famous mascot . The mascot is a lion. He roars . MGM shows a golden circle around the lion. MGM has six different lions. Leo the Lion is the most popular one. He is the mascot of MGM since 1957. Filmmakers use different materials 70 years ago. The lion is not good for today´s technology. MGM makes a new lion in a computer. The lion looks very similar. The quality is better. MGM wants to show the new lion before the latest ‘James Bond’ film. It is in 2019. Then cinemas must close. The ‘James Bond’ film will be in cinemas in 2021. MGM does not want to wait. The studio shows the new lion last week.	The MGM film studio started in 1924, and since then, its mascot was a lion. The roaring lion with a golden circle around it introduced all MGM films. MGM used five different lions before the famous Leo the Lion first appeared in 1957. Then technology changed and the quality of the mascot was not good anymore. Therefore, MGM made a new lion with the help of a computer. The lion looks very similar but the quality is better. MGM wanted to show the new mascot in the latest ‘James Bond’ film in 2019. Then there was a delay to 2021 because of the coronavirus. MGM did not want to wait any longer, and it will show the new mascot with its new films called ‘Dog’ and ‘Respect’.	It´s one of the most iconic images in cinema, a lion, framed by a golden circle of film stock, triumphantly roaring just before the opening credits roll. The MGM film studio has used a lion to introduce its films since it was founded in 1924, using five different animals before Leo the Lion made his first appearance in 1957. Now, after almost 100 years, MGM is replacing its mascot for a near-identical computer-generated duplicate. The move came after increases in video resolution and quality marked a significant change in quality since Leo was immortalized on celluloid 64 years ago. MGM originally planned to debut its new mascot in the latest ‘James Bond’ film; however, ‘No Time to Die’ was delayed from 2019 to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. MGM has decided Leo´s digital look-alike will be seen with upcoming films ‘Dog’ and ‘Respect’.
India launches a spacecraft . It flies towards Mars. It arrives there and it takes pictures. The mission costs 74 million dollars. The pictures are great. One picture shows the planet from pole to pole . You can see a big storm in the picture. The spacecraft took the picture 46,292 miles (74,500 km) above the planet.	India launched a spacecraft towards Mars in November 2013. It arrived in orbit last month, and it already took great pictures. The mission cost 74 million dollars. One of the pictures shows the red planet from pole to pole , and it shows a large dust storm on the photograph. The spacecraft took the picture at a distance of 46,292 miles (74,500 km) above the planet. Scientists expect the mission to last between 6 and 10 months.	India’s first spacecraft to visit Mars has beamed home this incredible photo of the red planet, a view that reveals the planet from pole to pole. The new photo from India’s Mangalyaan probe was unveiled on Monday by the Indian Space Research Organisation. Officials from the organisation wrote, “Something’s brewing here!” in a Twitter post for the Mars orbiter, as a huge dust storm was said to be blanketing part of the planet’s northern region. The spacecraft used its Mars Colour Camera to capture the stunning picture from a distance of 46,292 miles (74,500 km) above the planet on Sunday. It’s the third and best view of Mars from the spacecraft since it arrived in orbit around the planet last week. Mangalyaan is the centrepiece of India’s 74-million dollar mission, which launched towards the red planet in November 2013 and arrived in orbit last month. The mission is expected to last between 6 and 10 months.
Volkswagen is a German carmaker . The company uses a special software. This software changes information about emissions . A US government organization finds out the truth. It is a big scandal . People call the scandal Dieselgate. Volkswagen must change some parts in many of its cars. The company must pay lawyers. All this costs Volkswagen more than 38 billion dollars. It is important to find out who is responsible for Dieselgate. It seems that two men are responsible. One man is the boss of Volkswagen in the past. The other man is the boss on Audi in the past. Both men say that they do nothing wrong. Volkswagen says that the men must pay some money to the company.	Dieselgate was a scandal which happened in 2015. The German carmaker Volkswagen used illegal software to cheat emissions tests in the US. The company paid more than 38 billion dollars in legal costs, and it had to replace some parts in its cars. Volkswagen still develops new and better technologies, and last week, the company introduced its latest electric car in Dresden, Germany. Dieselgate still did not end, and Volkswagen is still having problems which are connected to the scandal. The company investigated what happened in Dieselgate, and it seemed that its former boss and former Audi boss were responsible for the scandal. Both men said that they did nothing wrong, but Volkswagen said that they had to pay some money to end the scandal.	On Friday, Volkswagen unveiled its latest electric car, the ID.4 SUV, that was showcased outside its factory in Dresden, Germany. However, as the industry continues its drive to go green , Volkswagen is still feeling the fallout from its emission scandal, also known as Dieselgate. It began in September 2015 when the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to Volkswagen. Volkswagen admitted that in 2015, it used illegal software to rig diesel engine tests in the US, which sparked the biggest crisis in the company´s history. The company announced that it would get damages from former Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and former Audi boss Rupert Stadler. Following a far-reaching legal investigation, Volkswagen concluded that Winterkorn and Stadler had breached their duty of care . However, both men denied responsibility for the scandal.

Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. It is also the closest to the sun. ESA (the European Space Agency) and Japan want to study the planet. They build a spacecraft. Its name is BepiColombo. People move it to South America. There is a European spaceport there. BepiColombo will leave to space in October from there. Going to Mercury is not easy. It will take seven years. It is even harder than going to Pluto. The sun is the problem. Its gravity is very powerful .	The ESA (European Space Agency) and Japan plan to study Mercury. They made a spacecraft named BepiColombo that is on its way to Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, which is in French Guiana in South America. BepiColombo will launch from there in October 2018. It will take seven years for the spacecraft to reach the planet’s orbit . The project scientist explained that getting to Mercury is even more difficult than getting to Pluto because of the sun and its powerful gravity. The spacecraft will have to make planetary flybys around Earth, Venus and Mercury. It will have to use a lot of energy to brake against the sun’s gravity.	A joint mission by the ESA (European Space Agency) and Japan plans to study Mercury’s structure and magnetic field. The planetary orbiter bound  for the journey named BepiColombo is currently being transported to Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana in South America. It will launch from there in October 2018. It will take seven years for the spacecraft to reach the planet’s orbitb and it will make flybys around Earth, Venus and Mercury itself. Johannes Benkoff, the project scientist from the ESA, explained that because the planet is so close to the sun, it is even more difficult to send a spacecraft to Mercury than to Pluto. The help of planetary flybys is needed to get there as well as a lot of energy to brake against the sun’s gravity.
Once a year, pandas can mate . Panda females can get pregnant for only 2 or 3 days. This makes getting pregnant difficult. Two pandas are in a zoo in Vienna, Austria. They mate a few times. This is special. The zoo films the pandas. They let people see the video. Pandas are pregnant for up to 163 days. The zoo must wait to see if the panda is pregnant.	Only once a year, the mating season for pandas happens. The females are only able to get pregnant for two or three days in a year, which makes getting pregnant difficult. In a zoo in Vienna, Austria, two pandas mated a few times, which is a rare event in a zoo. The zoo filmed the act and released the video. The length of a panda’s pregnancy is up to 163 days, so the zoo must wait to see if the mating was a success.	Pandas are known for their low libido, and females are only able to conceive for two or three days a year, which makes reproduction difficult. However, two pandas named Yang Yang and Long Hui at Vienna zoo seem to have fallen in love with each other and mated several times – a rare event in captivity for one of the world’s most endangered species . The panda’s gestation takes up to 163 days, so keepers will now wait to see if the mating was successful.
The EU wants to make a new law. The law will say that all smartphones, tablets, cameras, and other devices will have the same charger . Different devices often have different chargers. Connectors often do not come with the devices. People must buy them. People in the EU spend 2.4 billion euros on chargers every year. It is not possible to join some devices together. Everything will be much easier when only one connector exists. Another reason is that people will throw away less material. Companies like Apple are not happy with this idea. Apple uses a special charger. Apple says that the new law will be bad for making new products.	The EU wants to pass a new law which will make the charging port the same for smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, and other devices . It means that there should be only one type of charger for all these devices. Different devices use different connectors , and they do not always come with the device. Just in the EU, people spend more than 2.4 billion euros on chargers every year. If more devices used the same connectors, it would save money and lower waste . The new law would cause problems for companies like Apple, who uses its own special charger. An Apple spokesperson said that such a law will be bad for creating new products.	The European Commission said on Thursday that it wants a single type of charging port to be used for all smartphones and tablets, as well as equipment such as cameras, headphones, portable speakers, and handheld video consoles. The EU is hoping to pass a law that would standardize the charging port, with the EU´s industry chief Thierry Breton saying that with more devices, more chargers were sold that weren´t interchangeable or necessary, and the EU wanted to end that. The law would target companies like Apple whose iPhones and other products use the company´s own lightning charging port. The EU hopes that the standardization will cut waste and be more convenient for people who own multiple devices. However, an Apple spokesperson said that strict laws requiring just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it. Annually, EU consumers spend more than 2.4 billion euros on charging accessories for phones that actually don´t come with devices. The law could save consumers 250 million euros a year by cutting the cost for buying those new chargers.

Titanosaurs lived 100 million years ago. They lived in Argentina. They ate plants. They were 70 tonnes heavy. That is like ten elephants. People find a titanosaur. They move it to New York. The dinosaur goes into a museum. It is in a hall. It is longer than the hall. It does not fit inside completely. Its neck and its head run through the doorway into another room. Every year, five million people visit this museum.	In Argentina in 2014, people first discovered Titanosaurs, which are dinosaurs. They lived in the forests of Patagonia 100 million years ago. People excavated one Titanosaur and moved it to New York. It is now in the American Museum of Natural History. The dinosaur is 37 metres tall and it does not even fit into the fossil hall. Its neck and its head run through the doorway into another room. Around five million visitors a year will see the skeleton of the dinosaur. The titanosaur ate plants and it weighed around 70 tonnes – that is like 10 elephants.	In New York’s American Museum of Natural History, there is a giant herbivore Titanosaur spanning 37 metres. It is so big that it cannot even fit inside the institute’s fossil hall – its long neck and head poke out of the room, offering a surprise greeting to visitors. Palaeontologists think that the dinosaur, which roamed the forests around 100 million years ago, would have weighed about 70 tonnes; that is the weight of ten elephants. People first discovered the species in 2014 in Argentina’s Patagonia region. Palaeontologists excavated the Titanosaur in the Argentinian desert after a rancher gave them a tip, who noticed the fossils on his land. The Titanosaur was temporarily on display in New York, and around five million visitors come to the museum each year, proving that dinosaurs are still proper celebrities.

A company creates a hoverboard. The hoverboard is like a skateboard, but it has no wheels . It hovers 1 inch above the ground. The American company tests its 18th model. The hoverboard creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field pushes the board off the ground. You can give $100 to the company, and you can ride on the hoverboard. If you give the company $10,000, you can have the hoverboard.	A company in California says that it created the world’s first real hoverboard. The hoverboard is like a skateboard, but it has no wheels and it hovers 1 inch off the ground. The company is testing its 18th prototype. So how does it work? The hoverboard has four hover engines which create a special magnetic field. The field pushes against itself and levitates the board. If you give $100 to the company, it will let you ride the hoverboard for 5 minutes. If you help the company by giving it $10,000, you can have a hoverboard. But you will have to wait until October 2015.	A company in California claims to have created the world’s first real hoverboard. ARX PAX has developed a hoverboard prototype called Hendo, as well as Hendo Hover Engine developer kits, thanks to a kick-starter campaign to raise $250,000. And they plan on selling their technology to the general public as well. In fact, if you pledge $100 to the campaign, the company are offering a 5 minute ride on a hoverboard from March next year. For a cool $10,000 pledge, though, you could own your very own hoverboard. But you won’t get it until October 2015. Hendo can hover about 1 inch off the ground and this is the 18th prototype. So how does it work? Well, the hoverboard has four disc -shaped hover engines and these create a special magnetic field which pushes against itself, causing the lift which levitates the board off the ground. But if you’re not ready to hand over the cash just yet, the team has also developed a starter kit for the white box, which is the same technology, but in a white box.

This news is about a computer. It is the Apple-1. Steve Jobs created it in 1976. He sold it for 600 dollars. He sold it in his parent’s garage. His parent’s house was in California. The computer was not very powerful . However, it still was very important. It was the first personal computer. Charles Ricketts was the first owner of the computer. It is sometimes called the Ricketts Apple-1. The old computer is for sale now. It is very expensive. Its price is more than 0.5 million dollars.	The Apple-1 personal computer will go on sale at auction. People expect it to fetch more than half a million dollars. The computer still works. It is the only machine that Steve Jobs sold from his family home in California. Back then, in 1976, its price was 600 dollars. The Apple-1 had incredibly low power, but its creation was a historic milestone . It was the first personal computer. The first owner of the rare computer was Charles Ricketts. That’s why people sometimes call it the Ricketts Apple-1.	Long before the iPod, the iPhone and the black turtlenecks , there was this – the Apple-1 personal computer. This working model of the rare machine was sold by late Apple founder Steve Jobs right outside of his parents’ garage in 1976 for 600 dollars. Now, it’s about to go on sale at auction and is expected to fetch more than half a million dollars. The so-called Ricketts Apple-1 personal computer, named after original owner Charles Ricketts, is the only known machine of that model documented to have been directly sold by Jobs from his family home in Los Altos, California. And as original cofounder of Apple Ron Wayne explains, the creation of the Apple-1 was a historic milestone in personal computing. “It was monumental because until that time Jobs and Wozniak were the members or participants in a computer club where they took business machines and took bits and pieces and distilled them down into personal computer applications, but not very efficiently . And what Woz did, was to sit down and design extremely efficient circuit specifically arranged to serve as a personal computer. This had never been done before. And while it was very low-powered, incredibly low power, nonetheless it was a machine focused for personal use. The first time it had ever been done. And that was the basis of it.” The Ricketts Apple-1 will be sold as part of Christie’s inaugural  exceptional sale in New York later this month.

Four types of blood exist. The blood types are A, B, AB and 0. Every type is different. The blood type can affect some diseases. In the past, scientists discover that many people with SARS have blood type A. Scientists think that the blood type can affect the coronavirus, too. Scientists in the UK study thousands of people with COVID-19. 2,000 people have serious COVID-19. Thousands of other people have only mild COVID-19. Scientists compare these people´s blood types. The result is very interesting. People with blood type A have more health problems and more serious COVID-19. People with blood type 0 do not have so many health problems. Sometimes, people with blood type 0 have no COVID-19 symptoms at all.	This week, scientists in the UK published the study that linked blood types and the coronavirus. Scientists studied blood types of about 2,000 people who had serious COVID-19 and several thousands of people who had only mild or no symptoms. Scientists compared the blood types, and they came up with an interesting result. The study said that people with Type A blood usually had more serious COVID-19. Also, people with Type 0 blood did not usually have big health problems. This is not the first time when a blood type affects a disease. Scientists discovered a similar thing with SARS. Also, the blood type can increase the risk of illnesses like cholera or urinary infection.	Some people get very sick from COVID-19 while others do not. The reason why may be linked to a person´s blood type . A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at blood types of about 2,000 people in Europe with severe COVID-19 and compared them to several thousand other people who were healthy or who had only mild symptoms. Scientists found that people with Type A blood were more likely to have severe disease while people with Type 0 were less likely. The findings are similar to what scientists discovered during the SARS outbreak. In fact, blood type has been linked to an increase in developing other illnesses like cholera , urinary tract infections and ulcers that can cause stomach cancer.

After some time, they find one person. This person is shocked but alive. The situation of the other people is not sure. In August last year, a big earthquake hit the same region . 298 people die. This is a new tragedy in this region.	It was a race against time in the worst possible conditions. A rescue team went towards an isolated hotel. The hotel was under snow after four earthquakes started an avalanche in the central Italian region. People believed that at least 20 guests and seven members of staff were trapped inside the hotel. The road was still blocked by snow and cars were of little use. The team of rescuers had to go to the hotel through the storm on skis. They had only the light from their head torches to help navigate through the terrain . Once they were at the hotel, they quickly started to search for life. After digging their way inside, they found one lucky guest, shaken, but unharmed, but the situation of many others is still uncertain. In August last year, a huge earthquake hit the same mountainous region, which left 298 people dead. This latest natural disaster is likely to deliver even more tragedy.

Scientists believe that the ritual happens when a child becomes an adult. The handprints are more than 1,200 years old. The Maya culture is so strong and rich at that time. Millions of Mayas still live in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.	Archaeologists found handprints in a cave in Mexico. The cave was near a famous tourist destination , Chichen Itza. Many black and red handprints covered the walls of the cave, and archaeologists believed that they were a part of a Maya ritual . Children made the handprints more than 1,200 years ago. The black color symbolized death and in the ritual, it meant the end. The red color symbolized war or a person´s life in society. Archaeologists said that the ritual happened when a child became an adult. The handprints come from the time when the Maya culture was strong and rich. Millions of Mayas still live in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.	Mysterious findings inside an underground cave in Mexico shed  some  light on ancient Maya rituals. Dozens of black and red handprints cover the walls of the cave, and they are believed to be associated with a coming-of-age ritual of the ancient Maya. The handprints are mostly made by children, and they date back more than 1,200 years when Maya´s advanced culture was at its zenith . According to archaeologists, the colors have a meaning. The black color symbolized death; however, it didn´t mean that the children were going to be killed but rather death from a ritual perspective . The color red referred to war or life when children went out and they came in contact with the rest of society in a safe way. The cave is located near the northern tip of the Yucatan peninsula that houses the popular archaeological tourist site, Chichen Itza. Several million Maya still live in communities across southeastern Mexican states as well as Guatemala and Belize.
People throw away a lot of food. The United Nations (UN) says that people throw away 930 million tons of food in 2019. Households throw away about a half of this food. Stores, restaurants, schools, or hospitals throw away the other half. The UN wants to know where the problem is. The problem is everywhere. Farmers throw away crops . The UN finds out that 14% of food does not get to stores. People want to buy only nice fruit and vegetables. Not all fruit and vegetables look nice. People buy too much food, too. They do not eat it all. They throw it away. The Problem with food is not only in rich countries. Recent reports say that the numbers for 2020 will be much worse than the numbers from 2019.	According to the United Nations, people threw away about 930 million tons of food in 2019. Households were responsible for more than a half of it, while stores and companies which worked in food service were responsible for the rest. The UN found out that problems were in the whole process of food production and that 14% of food did not even get to stores. All the food, which people threw away, made 10% of the world´s emissions . It was interesting that it did not happen only in rich countries, but in developing countries , too. The numbers from 2019 are huge, but the recent reports suggest that people threw away two times more food in 2020.	According to the United Nations Environment Program, some 931 million tons of food went to waste in 2019. Individual householders were responsible for more than a half of the amount, with the rest coming from retailers and the food service industry. New estimates show that about 17% of food available to consumers worldwide in 2019 ended up being wasted. UN analysts tracked the problem further up the supply chain , and the matter is even more urgent when considered that 14% of food production is lost before it reaches stores. Waste is happening at every point from field to the dinner table. Food waste and loss are responsible for 10% of global emissions, and if it were a country, this discard would rank third in the world´s sources of greenhouse gases, after China and the US. However, the problem isn´t limited to the richest countries, and recent reports suggest that the amount of food wasted by consumers could be about double the previous estimate.
This news is about tortoises. Tortoises live in the Galapagos Islands. People discover a new type of tortoise. It lives in a 39-square-kilometre area. There are around 250 tortoises of this type. They live in the east of Santa Cruz Island. The new species is different genetically . It also looks different.	People identified a new species of giant tortoise in the Galapagos Islands. The new species lives in a 39-square-kilometre area in the east of Santa Cruz Island. There are around 250 of the newly discovered tortoises, and they are genetically different from a large group of tortoises that live in the western part of the island. In addition to genetic differences, the two Santa Cruz Island species are also different in the shapes of their shells .	A new species of giant tortoise has been identified in the Galapagos Islands. Scientists used genetic data to determine that a group of 250 of the slow-moving grazing  reptiles was distinct from other tortoise species residing in the Pacific archipelago . The newly identified species lives in a 15-square-mile area of Santa Cruz Island and is as different genetically from the other giant tortoise species on the island as species from other islands. The research differentiated the new Eastern Santa Cruz tortoise, given the scientific name “Chelonoidis donfaustoi”, from a larger population of about 2,000 tortoises living about 6 miles away on the western part of the island. In addition to genetic differences, the two Santa Cruz Island species also differ in the shape of their shell, with the Eastern Santa Cruz tortoise having one with a more compressed shape.  It brings the number of Galapagos giant tortoise species to 15. The new species’ scientific name honours a recently retired National Galapagos Park ranger named Fausto Llerena Sanchez, the former caretaker of the famed giant tortoise Lonesome George who died in 2012 at the age of 102.

Swedish scientists do an experiment . They put a cloth on a glacier . The glacier is the Helags Glacier in the north of Sweden. All glaciers in the world are melting . This happens because the planet is getting warmer. Scientists are thinking of ways on how to stop it. They put a cloth on the top of the Helags Glacier in summer. The cloth stops the sun. It keeps the glacier cold. Scientists save at least 3.5 meters of ice. The ice does not melt. The melting of glaciers is a serious problem. Scientists believe that more people know about the problem now.	Swedish scientists did an experiment on the Helags Glacier in the north of the country. The scientists put a special cloth on the top of the glacier during the summer months. The cloth was made of very strong and durable material which blocked the sun and UV radiation . It also kept the glacier cold. The team said that they saved at least 3.5 meters of ice from melting . Glaciers are melting all over the world as a result of warmer temperatures. It is important that more people know about the problem because it will be more serious in the future, and people will have to solve it.	Researchers performed an experiment on the Helags Glacier in northern Sweden. They used a cloth sheet to shield a part of the glacier over the summer, and they said that the cloth saved at least 3.5 meters in height from melting. The sheet was about one and a half meters thick, and it was very strong and durable. It hindered the sun and UV radiation, and it also isolated the ice from warm air. Global warming is causing glaciers to shrink all over the world, and researchers hope to redo their test on a larger size, so they can raise awareness about the dangers many peoples will face if the glaciers disappear.

A US company builds a special house. The house is from concrete . It is not from bricks . A 3D printer makes the house. The house is in New York State. It is a demo house. It means that nobody lives in it. People can come and look at it. The house is 180 square meters large. The printer makes it in two days. Some people like it. Some people do not like it very much. Older people prefer the usual way of building homes. Young people know 3D printers. They like this idea more. 3D printers use concrete. Concrete is a usual material for building. It is possible that houses from 3D printers will be a normal thing in the future.	A company made an unusual house. The house was from concrete , but a big 3D printer made it. The house was a demo house and the company built it in Calverton, New York, US. The house was 180 square meters large, and it took 48 hours to print it. When the concrete dried, builders made a roof, and then they finished the inside of the house. People´s reactions were positive and negative, too. The director of the company said that some people were not ready for such a different way of building houses. Older people and businessmen did not know anything about 3D printing and it was all new for them. Younger people, who knew 3D printing, usually liked the house. Some people believe that building houses with the help of 3D printers will be more usual in the future.	Most homes are built block by block or brick by brick. However, a demo house in Calverton, New York, US, was constructed scan by scan with walls made using a giant 3D printer. The house is 180 square meters with a total print time of 48 hours. After the concrete was set up and dry enough, the truss roof system was installed, and then, the interior was finished. The company is building a near-identical home which is on the market for 299,000 dollars, and the feedback that they get is both positive and negative. According to the company´s director, people are simply unprepared for how construction of homes is going to change. Younger people know 3D printing and it´s a great thing for them. However, some older tradesmen and gentlemen in the field don´t know what 3D printing is and how a house can be made on a 3D printer. 3D printing is a viable way to build because concrete is used which is abundant and used every day all over the world.

At first, doctors told her that it was migraines . However, later, they found out that it was a brain tumor . Joey got scared, and she imagined the long and difficult therapy that she would have to have. However, scientists work hard to find better and more effective ways to work with cancer. Now scientists are able to cut off the blood supply to the tumor. Such therapy makes the tumor smaller, and the therapy does not have so many side effects . During the therapy, Joey´s hope was to play soccer again. It helped her get better faster. Last month, her hope came true, and she could enjoy another game.	About eight months ago, 15-year-old Joey Martin started getting headaches. At first, she was told it was migraines; however, a CT scan revealed a tumor on the stem of her brain. Dr. Douglas Graham, Chief of the Cancer and Blood Disorders Center in Atlanta, said that thanks to advances in medicine, it was possible to cure children in a way that was less toxic and had less side effects to the patient. Scientists have discovered a type of antibody that they use to cut off the blood supply to the tumor and make it shrink. Every second of her fight against cancer, Joey dreamed of getting back onto the field and playing soccer. Last month, it became reality, and her parents said that what Joey had done was an absolute miracle.

In London, people protest . They are angry. The government wants to spend less money. It wants to spend less money on people. The protesters say that the cuts are a problem. They think that it will be a problem for some groups of people, like people who are old, ill or young. They say that it is not fair. They say that the problems come from rich people. One protester also says that the government is wrong. The government says that most people like it. He says that people do not like the government very much.	In London, people protested in response to the new conservative government’s plans for public spending  cuts . The protesters were worried that the cuts would hurt the vulnerable , such as the young, the disabled, people with mental illnesses and the elderly. The protesters said that the cuts weren’t fair as everyone else had to suffer for the mistakes of the few people who had money. One protester also said that the new government was not truly as popular as it said it was.	Thousands of protesters packed the streets of London’s financial district on Saturday to demonstrate against the newly reelected conservative government’s plans for public spending cuts. Protesters gathered outside the Bank of England to listen to speeches before marching through central London towards Parliament. “I think there’s a genuine need to stop austerity and cuts to the vulnerable , particularly the disabled, the elderly, and the young, the young… The government seems to be very interested, almost obsessed with cutting benefits for young people who are looking for work.” “I just don’t think the poor should have to suffer for the mistakes of the rich. It’s affecting the vulnerable, the disabled, the mentally ill, people who just want to make it, perhaps who don’t have the best start in the life, and they don’t want to be suffering from the mistakes of the few, the few at the top.” Since winning the election, Conservative Finance Minister George Osborne has said he wants government departments to make extra cuts this year to commit future governments to run budget  surpluses during normal economic times. “You know, at the election light, they always say the Tories got a majority, but they only got about 800 or 600,000 more votes than they did in 2010, so you know, they didn’t really, they didn’t get a big mandate for their full manifesto , which is what they’re claiming. 25% of people voted Tory, you know, that’s nothing. So I think a lot of people from up and down the country are here cause they’ve just had enough. They’ve had enough of austerity, of cuts, of privitasation. They don’t agree with that.” The protest was organised by the People’s Assembly Against Austerity, an umbrella  group with support from trade unions, antiwar protesters, and some Labour and Green party politicians.
5G is the newest mobile network. A mobile network is how our cell phones work for phone calls, texting, and data. 5G is very fast and reliable . People can communicate better. Now scientists are thinking about 6G. Scientists in the UK want to teleport all five human senses through the mobile network. The senses are seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling. People can send only seeing and hearing now. 5G cannot send the other senses. 5G is not fast enough. Scientists believe that 6G can send all the human senses. Many things will be possible with 6G. Scientists say that a sick person can meet with his doctor. The person does not need to visit the doctor. The doctor teleports in his home.	Currently, 5G technology is starting, but some scientists are already thinking about 6G, and what technology it could bring. Researchers in the UK want to use 6G technology for virtual teleportation and to transmit all the human senses. It is possible now to transmit seeing and hearing, and researchers believe that with very fast 6G technology, they could transmit touch, taste, and smell, too. For virtual teleportation, many things must happen at exactly the same time. It is not possible with 5G because it is not fast enough. Researchers say that 6G will bring many new possibilities . They believe that it will be possible to meet your doctor without visiting him in his office.	Researchers in the UK are hoping to harness 6G technology to start virtual teleportation by sending all the human senses and to turn science fiction into science fact. According to Rahim Tafazoli, the founder and director of the Institute for Communications Systems, since 1G, all the way to 5G, scientists managed to send only two of the human senses, which are seeing and hearing. Tafazoli and his team are now trying to add the other three senses, which are touch, taste, and smell. To enable virtual reality images to interact will requires high accurate time synchronization which is not possible with 5G technology. However, once super fast 6G is possible, it will open huge possibilities. The technology could allow our virtual reality selves to do much more than only interact on a screen. For example, our doctor could come to our house, touch our hand, and feel our temperature, as if we were seeing him face to face in his office.

Scientists use a telescope . This telescope is called the Kepler telescope. It is powerful. The scientists find a planet with it. The planet is 1,400 light years away. The planet is called Kepler-452. It is 60 per cent bigger than Earth. The planet moves around a star. This star is like our sun. The planet is at a good distance from the star. There can be liquid water on the planet. Maybe, life exists on the planet.	Scientists used NASA’s powerful Kepler telescope and they found a planet. It is about 60 per cent bigger than Earth, and it is located 1,400 light years away. The planet is now known as Kepler-452. It circulates a star at a distance which is similar to Earth’s orbit . The planet’s star is similar to the sun. It is only older. The planet is special because it is cool enough to have liquid water on the surface. Therefore, life could be possible on such a planet.	Scientists using NASA’s powerful Kepler telescope have found a planet beyond the solar system that’s a close match to Earth. The planet, which is about 60 per cent bigger than Earth, is located about 1,400 light years away. The latest discovery is known as Kepler-452b. While similar-sized planets have been found before, Kepler-452b is a circulating star that is very similar but older than the sun at a distance about the same as Earth’s orbit. Based on its size, mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earthlike planet yet. Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface and might therefore be hospitable to life. The planet is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.

This news is from Great Britain. When children are bad, their parents  can smack them. Experts from the United Nations advise Britain. They say that smacking is not OK. They say that parents should not smack their children. They say that when a child is bad, you can do something else. Britain should tell parents what else they can do.	In Great Britain, parents must not injure their children, but they are allowed to give a mild smack when their children are bad. A report by eighteen United Nations experts said that Britain should pass new laws. The experts believe that smacking is a form of corporal punishment , and that Britain should put an end to corporal punishment. Britain should also explain to its people how to punish children without hitting them.	A United Nations report has recommended that Britain should pass laws to ban parents from smacking their children at home. The directions were issued by the UN Human Rights Committee as it published an assessment of legal and cultural issues in the UK. Eighteen experts who make up the body found that the UK should take practical and legal steps to put an end to corporal punishment, meaning it believes smacking at home to be a form corporal punishment. The report also says Britain should encourage campaigns which back non-violent forms of discipline. Parents are not explicitly banned from striking their children. The law currently allows for reasonable chastisement to control a child’s behaviour, but parents can be prosecuted if their actions result in injuries such as bruises, cuts or scratches. On the current policy, a government spokeswoman said, “their policy on smacking is clear. They do not condone violence towards children. At the same time, they don’t wish to criminalise parents for issuing a mild smack.” The review was made up of international experts who monitor the implementation of civil and political rights. It’s the first review of Britain since 2008.

For instance, the design of this model is centred around the panorama of the Moscow skyline and the name of President Putin and the artistically reproduced signature of the president. Because in our world we live in, the President of the Russian Federation is a true symbol of our strong independent country, so his image can be used as the real symbol of our times.” The company has somewhat of a track record in Putin paraphernalia . Last year, the company sold special edition Russian-themed customised iPhones complete with the image of the president’s face.
Red phone boxes are typical in Britain. They are a big tourist attraction. However, people do not use them anymore. They have mobile phones. There are fewer and fewer phone boxes. One company wants to change this. The company turns the boxes into small offices. They have Wi-Fi, plug sockets, a phone, a printer, a scanner and free coffee and tea. The first work station opens this month. It opens in London. More work stations are coming soon.	The iconic red phone boxes were once everywhere in Britain, and they were a popular tourist attraction. However, in the age of smartphones, their numbers are growing smaller. One company thought that it was a good idea to take the phone boxes into the 21st century. The company decided to turn them into small offices with Wi-Fi, plug sockets, a phone, a printer, a scanner and free coffee and tea. The company launches its first work station in London this month and it is opening others soon. It plans to expand to other cities in October.	Britain’s red phone boxes might not be used for their original purpose anymore in an age of smartphones, but one company is giving the famous booths a makeover as small offices. Pod Works is hoping to lure people from coffee shops to work on their laptops in its revamped booths, which while not for the claustrophobic, boast Wi-Fi, plug sockets, a phone, a printer, a scanner and free coffee and tea. “We thought it was a good idea to re-purpose these and take them into the 21st century. The sheer volume of tourists that come and stand by the box and take selfies and photographs indicates just how iconic and important they are.” Once dotting British cities, towns, and villages, the iconic red phone boxes dwindled in numbers over the years. Pod Works launches its first work station in London’s Russell Square this month and it is opening others across the capital soon. It plans to expand to other cities in October.

Last Wednesday, people saw a car floating in the Niagara River near the Niagara Falls on the US-Canada border. The car was almost completely under water, and police used a drone to see if  somebody was inside. A helicopter brought a diver who got into the car. Luckily, the car was not locked, so the man did not need to break a window. Sadly, when he got inside the car, he saw that the driver was dead. It was a very brave rescue because the water near the falls was very rough, and there was a strong icy wind. Police learned that the driver was a woman in her late 60s, and she lived in the area.

According to police, the driver was a woman in her late 60s who lived in the area, and she likely drove into the Niagara River on purpose. It was unclear how exactly the car was in the river; however, witnesses reported seeing it floating near a bridge.

Poland has a new law. The law is about abortion. Abortion means that doctors end a woman´s pregnancy . The new law makes abortion illegal . Abortion will be legal only in special situations. The situations are a sexual attack and a sexual relationship between members of one family. It will also be legal when the mother´s life will be at risk . Poland is a very religious country. Many people are happy with the new law. But some people do not agree with the new law. Many women believe that they can decide about their life. Poland´s law is one of the strictest in Europe. It separates the country from the rest of Europe.	On Thursday, Poland´s top court decided that it was not legal to end a pregnancy if the baby had health problems in the mother´s body. The court decided that it was only possible in case of rape , incest, or when the pregnancy was a risk to the mother´s life. Poland is a highly religious country, and pro-life activists welcomed the court´s decision. They said that Poland was an example for all of the world. People who fight for women´s rights were not happy and they protested in the streets of Poland´s capital, Warsaw. The court´s decision separates Poland from most of Europe because only two European countries have such strict abortion laws.	On Thursday, Poland´s top court ruled that abortion due to fetal defects was unconstitutional. Poland is a predominantly Catholic country, and the decision ends one of the last legal grounds to terminate a pregnancy. The procedure will now be allowed in case of rape, incest , or a threat to the mother´s life. The decision was met with support from pro-life activists who said that Poland was an example for Europe and for the world. However, women´s rights activists were shocked by the decision, and they protested in the streets of the capital city of Warsaw. Many doctors in Poland already exercise their legal right to refuse to terminate pregnancies on religious grounds. The court´s decision further distances Poland from most of Europe as one of only two EU countries to severely restrict access to abortion.

Blue Origin is a company. It makes rockets. These rockets can carry cargo and people into space. Blue Origin tests a rocket. It takes off in Texas. It flies to 100 kilometres above the ground. Then, it comes back. It lands standing up eight minutes later. At 100 kilometres above the ground, the atmosphere ends and space starts. Gravity does not work there.	Blue Origin is one of the companies which is developing vehicles to carry cargo and people into space. Blue Origin’s spacecraft the New Shepherd took off from West Texas last Monday. Eight minutes later, it safely landed standing up. It reached the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and space which is 100 kilometres above the surface of Earth. Blue Origin designed the rocket to carry six passengers into Earth’s upper atmosphere. There, the passengers can experience  weightlessness . The New Shepherd will carry scientists who will run experiments during their few minutes of weightlessness.	“Welcome back New Shepherd!” A space rocket designed to take off and land standing up has successfully done just that. Blue Origin’s New Shepherd spacecraft took off from West Texas in the US on Monday 23rd November with no one aboard. “And lift-off.” On launch, it reached an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometres), breaching the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and space. It landed back at the launch site eight minutes later. The pressurized passenger capsule successfully separated from its booster before making a soft touchdown via a set of parachutes, lowering itself vertically. The rocket is designed to carry six passengers into Earth’s upper atmosphere, where they’ll be able to experience weightlessness. Amazon.com’s founder and head of space private firm Blue Origin is behind the spacecraft, which is also among a handful of companies developing vehicles to carry cargo and paying passengers into space. New Shepherd is likely to fly in the first instance as a platform for science, allowing researchers to run experiments during the few minutes of weightlessness experienced in the capsule at the top of its arc .

“Mein Kampf” is a German book. Adolf Hitler wrote it in 1925. After World War Two, Germany banned the book. You could not buy it. After 90 years, the book is legal again. Experts work on the book.

A book accused of spawning the beginning of Nazi Germany 90 years ago, Hitler’s “Mein Kampf”, or “My Struggle”, has been republished by Germany with mixed reactions.bMany have argued that the republishing of the text is inflammatory and racist, but the biographers behind the release say it is a useful educational tool. Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in Lansberg prison in 1925 ,and 90 years later, copyright on the text, which was banned by the Allies at the end of World War Two, has expired, opening the way for this critical edition with explanatory sections and over 3,500 critical annotations . “That’s exactly what we are doing, de-constructing Hitler, the Hitler myth and also the racism and ideology underlying all his political arguments.” On Friday, the 2,000-page, two- volume work went on sale after about three years of labour by scholars at Munich’s Institute for Contemporary History. Auschwitz survivor Ziggy Shipper is appalled that Mein Kampf is back in print. “I just feel bad about it, you know, because I wouldn’t like to see. You know the worst thing is, not even reading but if I were to walk by a bookshop or something and see that book… I’d feel bad. Kampf might cause more racism or anti-Semitism.” But students at a Berlin school had mixed reactions to the reprint. “I think it should be re-published. I think it’s important that we learn from our mistakes that we made in the past. I don’t think anybody would take Mein Kampf seriously any more because it was written in a different time.” “It should be not re-published in Germany because we have such a big movement at the moment that is going to sympathise with the people that are against immigrants.” “Well I think it should definitely be discussed in school, but I think a public access to the book is not healthy.” Whatever your opinion, the publication is a big step for Germany, which still struggles with the legacy of the Nazi era and the Holocaust .

The co-founder of the museum is somewhat of a poo enthusiast and during an interview, he retold the time that he and his friends were in the wilds of Northern Sweden. There they came across a poo, but they were unable to identify it. He noticed how excited everyone became. Apart from the fascination, there is actually a scientific reason to study poo. An education and conservation officer from the Isle of Wight Zoo explained that scientists use it for health screening, looking for parasites, or monitoring the chemicals within. In order to take the poo in the resin , it has to be completely desiccated , which is a process that takes around an hour for insect poo and a couple of weeks for a lion’s. The team even designed and built a special machine just for this job.

Ian Dai, 33-year-old winemaker, quit a university in Sydney, Australia. and he found his passion in wine. His goal has taken him to the desert hills near the Mongolian border, and he has determined to find how different regions of wine taste.

China’s modern day winemaking dates back to the 1980’s, when French businesses put money into wineries. By the 2000’s, Chinese wine had improved in quality, thanks to a focus on growing healthier and riper grapes.

Norilsk is a city in Russia. It is the northernmost city in Russia. It lies close to the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line about 2,600 kilometers from the North Pole. It means that this place is very cold. Snow starts to fall a lot in Norilsk a few weeks ago. High winds have a speed of 100 kmph. Cars and roads are under the snow. Authorities must close the airport. It is not safe for planes. Authorities clear around 400,000 tons of snow. The weather is wild. The local people have problems to travel to work. Winters in Norilsk are always cold and hard. Bad weather does not make the people unhappy.	The city of Norilsk is located in Siberia, Russia, and it is the most northerly city in the country. It lies only 300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle which is an imaginary line that marks the north of Earth. A few weeks ago, high winds of up to 100 kmph brought heavy snowfall . In some places, the snow was more than two meters high. It buried cars and roads. The winds were so strong that local authorities decided to close the local airport. Authorities said that they cleared around 400,000 tons of snow from the city in the last two months. The extreme weather had a big impact on traveling , but it did not seem to upset local people at all.	For the past week, residents of the most northerly city in Siberia, Russia, have been waking up to more and more snow. The city of Norilsk is located 300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle , and in December, the temperature can reach minus 30 degrees Celsius. The city has been battered by snowstorms for days, with blizzards reaching 100 kmph. Local authorities estimate that they have removed 400,000 tons of snow from the city over the past two months. In some places, the snow reached head height and it completely buried vehicles and roads. The extreme weather has caused significant disruption to public transport and air travel with the airport being currently closed. However, the residents have not let the harsh winds and huge piles of snow get them down.
Airbus opens a new factory. It makes Zephyr drones . The drones are solar-powered. They fly 18–21 kilometres above the ground. That is very high. When they fly, they are above the weather. They are above normal aeroplanes. They can be in the air for two months. Airbus has two Zephyr models. One is smaller and the other is big.  The factory is making the smaller one. Its wingspan is 25 metres. It weighs just 75 kilogrammes. The Zephyr can provide the Internet. It can take pictures and videos, too. It can help in different situations.	Airbus opened a new production facility where it can produce 30 Zephyr aircrafts a year, which are solar-powered aircraft. These drones fly 18–21 kilometres above the ground which means that they are above the weather and normal aeroplanes. Airbus says that the Zephyr can fly for months at a time. The smaller production model has a wingspan of 25 metres and weighs less than 75 kg. It is able to provide the Internet, radar and take pictures and video. From the 18-to-21-kilometre altitude , it can see objects as small as 15 centimetres.	Airbus opened a production facility for its solar-powered unmanned Zephyr aircraft which will be flying in altitudes of 18–21 kilometres above the ground. Zephyr is a High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) which fills the gap between satellites and UAV s. It will fly in the stratosphere above the weather and conventional air traffic, harnessing solar energy and able to fly for months at a time. Airbus says that the aircraft will revolutionise defence, humanitarian and environmental missions all over the world. However, with the facility being able to produce only up to 30 aircraft a year, the project is at its beginning. The smaller production model has a wingspan of 25 metres and weighs less than 75 kg. It is able to provide the Internet, radar, and take pictures and video – from the 18-to-21-kilometre height, it will be able to see objects as small as 15 centimetres.
Things are not good for many people in Bangladesh. First there is very heavy rain. There are floods . Sixty-one people die. Over 800,000 people must leave their homes. Water is everywhere. This is good for mosquitoes. There are so many of them. This is bad because mosquitoes transmit diseases . One of the diseases is the dengue fever. Many people catch this fever. More than 1,000 people catch it in just 24 hours. It hits Bangladesh’s capital very hard. Hospitals do not have enough room for everybody.	Recently, heavy rains and floods hit Bangladesh, killing at least 61 people, and over 800,000 people had to leave their homes. The wet environment means that there are now many mosquitoes which transmit diseases . One of the diseases is the dengue fever. It is a lot like having the flu, but you can die from the dengue. Eight or more people died in Bangladesh of dengue this year, and more than 13,000 are sick with it. Last week, there were over 1,000 cases of dengue in just 24 hours. Bangladesh told CNN that the outbreak is the worst since 2000.  Dhaka, the country’s capital, was hit the hardest, and hospitals do not have enough room for all the sick people.	Recently, heavy monsoon rains and floods hit Bangladesh, killing at least 61 people, and displacing over 800,000. The wet environment is perfect for mosquitoes which transmit diseases, and one of them is the dengue fever. It causes flu-like symptoms, vomiting or a rash. At least eight people died in Bangladesh this year and more than 13,000 were sickened. Over 1,000 of those cases were diagnosed over the period of 24 hours last week. Bangladesh told CNN that the outbreak is the worst since it started keeping records of dengue cases in 2000. Dhaka, the country’s capital, has been hit the hardest, as hospitals do not have enough room for all the sick people.
People like to drink. However, we are not alone. Scientists study animals for 17 years. They now know that animals drink, too. Plants have sap in them. Sap can become alcohol. Chimpanzees drink the alcohol.	Many people like a drink from time to time, but it seems that animals enjoy alcohol, too. Scientists thought this for a while, but now, we have proof. Scientists studied the drinking of animals for 17 years. Chimpanzees, for example, use leaves as a sponge to collect fermented sap from palm trees. Then they put the leaves into their mouths to drink the alcohol.	People have been fermenting alcohol for a long time as they enjoy alcohol’s effects, and as it turns out, some animals enjoy it, too! International researchers conducted a 17-year-long empirical study and found that some chimpanzees drink alcohol from leaf vessels . Video footage showed a chimp using leaves to collect fermented  sap from a palm tree. The scientists observed the animals in many states of inebriation , including falling asleep after drinking.
US scientists make special robots. They call them Xenobots. Xenobots can reproduce . How do they reproduce? Scientists make the robots from frog cells . These cells come from frog eggs. The cells move in water. They make pellets . Scientists change some pellets with more frog eggs. Nothing happens for a few days. Then, the pellets reproduce. No plants or animals reproduce in the same way. Scientists see nothing like this before. There must be strong rules about how to use these robots in the future.	US scientists made the first living robots which looked like the computer game character Pac Man. An AI made the robots, which scientists called Xenobots, and they were the first robots which could reproduce or make copies of themselves. Scienists made the robots from skin cells from frog eggs. They put the cells together, and the cells started to move in water. They formed into pellets , and scientists wanted to see what would happen if they changed some pellets with more frog cells. They did this, and a few days later, the pellets started to reproduce. The way that the robots reproduced is very different, as no plants or animals do it this way. Scientists are now deciding how they can use this technology. It is clear that there will be strict rules about it in the future.	US scientists, who made the world´s first computer-designed living robots, say that the ´Pac Man´ shaped organisms are capable of self-reproduction. The robots designed by AI are known as Xenobots, and they are made from a skin cells from frog eggs. Scientists put the skin cells together, and in certain conditions, that group of cells keeps its shape. It starts moving in fresh water in a Petri dish of its own volition . The group moves around, and it happened to push other shapes or pellets into piles. This led scientists to the idea of what would happen if they replaced these pellets with more loose frog cells. As a result, the robots pushed frog cells into piles, and they stuck to one another. Over about five days, if the pile was big enough, it started to reproduce by sprouting small hairs, and the pile started to move. This reproduction method is entirely new, unlike the way any existing plant or animal copies itself. In theory, these robots could do useful work for people, which is what actually makes them robots.
One man from Germany drives an expensive car. It is a McLaren. A McLaren costs more than €140,000. One time, the man parks against a donkey enclosure . His car is orange. A donkey thinks that maybe it is a carrot. It tries to eat the car. It scratches it. The driver comes back to his car. He sees the scratch. He wants the donkey’s owner to give him €5,000.

Cape Town is in South Africa. People see strange clouds in the sky there. The clouds look like UFO s. The clouds scare some people. They talk about this on the Internet.	In Cape Town, South Africa, people saw very unusual clouds in the sky. People call them “ lenticular clouds” and they look like flying saucers . Some people got scared because they thought that the clouds were UFO s. They talked about this on the Internet.	Above the scenic  cityscapes of Cape Town in South Africa, something odd is happening in the skies. As the clouds gather  pace , panic ensues and people take to social media to show their fear. There’s talk of tornadoes, UFOs and even aliens! But returning back to Earth for a moment, meteorologists are calling them “lenticular clouds”. These are lens-shaped and typically stationary . They form when air flows along the surface of the earth and reaches some sort of obstruction point like a mountain. That then diverts the flow of moving air and because the airflow contains moist air within it, a series of large-scale standing waves can develop. Then the alien-like shapes take form and when the moist air flows down to the back of the wave, the clouds eventually evaporate and vanish . So next time you’re witness to a spectacle of the skies, it may be worth getting your phone out to record any unusual movements.

A cactus blooms in a botanic garden in Cambridge, England, UK. Cactus usually grows in hot and dry places. It has thick green leaves with sharp ends. This is a very special cactus. It usually grows in Central and South America. Only 13 botanic gardens in the world have this cactus. Its name is Selinecereus. Botanists call it ‘moonflower’. Moonflower has beautiful, big flowers. The smell is very strong and sweet. Moonflower blooms for only one night. Botanists from Cambridge watch the cactus all week. They do not sleep at night. They want to see the flower. When the cactus blooms, they are very happy. It happens for the first time in the UK. The plant dies after a few hours. The smell changes. The flower smells like old food.	Selinecereus is a special cactus that naturally grows in Central and South America. People sometimes call it the ‘moonflower’ because it blooms only for one night. Only 13 botanic gardens in the world grow this plant, and last week, it bloomed in the UK. Botanists were very excited because it happened in the UK for the first time. Botanists at Cambridge University did not sleep all week, and they watched the plant all the time. They did not want to miss the chance to see the 28-centimeter flower. The flower smells very strongly and sweetly, but when the plant begins to die, the smell changes and it is very unpleasant.	A rare Amazonian cactus called Selinecereus, or the moonlight cactus, has bloomed for what botanists believe is the first time in the UK. The plant is naturally found in Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America, and it has white flowers that only last a single night in most species. It is cultivated only in 13 botanic gardens in the world. Experts at Cambridge University´s Botanic Garden kept a night watch throughout the week so that they didn´t miss the flowering of the moonlight cactus, an event that usually begins at sunset and it is over by sunrise. The ‘moonflower’ actually bloomed earlier on Saturday afternoon at around 3 pm, and the garden said that it was 28 centimeters long. The strongly desired flower produces a sweet-smelling scent that turns rancid after just two hours as the plant begins to die.

The Hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage . It is a pilgrimage to Mecca. It happens every year. Every Muslim man must make the pilgrimage. Many people go to Mecca. The streets are full of people. This is dangerous. There is a crush . 700 people die in the crush. It injures more than 800 people. People do not respect the timetables . This is why this happened.	The Hajj is an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca. It happens every year, and every Muslim man must make the pilgrimage at least once in his life. Two accidents happened during this year’s Hajj. Two large groups of people arrived at a crossroads outside of Mecca. There was a crush in which 700 people died and 863 were injured. The incident happened because people did not respect the timetables, and too many of them moved. People are investigating the incident. The second disaster happened two weeks ago. A crane collapsed at a square and killed 109 people.	King Salman has ordered a safety review into the Hajj pilgrimage after a crush outside the Muslim holy city of Mecca killed over 700 people. The Saudi King also called for a swift investigation into the incident in which 863 pilgrims were injured. “We have instructed the concerned  bodies to investigate this tragic incident and provide us with the result as soon as possible. It will not reduce the importance of security force efforts to help the pilgrims in practising the ritual. Regardless of the investigation results, the improvement of the methods and mechanisms of the Hajj season will not stop. We have instructed the concerned entities to re-evaluate the current policy and the distribution of responsibilities.” The disaster occurred when two large groups of people arrived together at a crossroads in Mina on their way to performing the “stoning of the devil” ritual at Jamarat. The Saudi Health Minister said the crush occurred because too many people moved “without respecting the timetables” established by authorities. It’s the deadliest incident to occur at the pilgrimage since July 1990, when 1,426 pilgrims suffocated in a tunnel near Mecca. The incident is the second disaster to strike the holy site in two weeks, after a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque, killing 109 people.

This news is about ivory. Ivory is a material. It comes from an elephant’s tusks . It is an expensive material. People kill elephants to get it and sell it. This is a problem. Kenya wants to stop the elephant killing. It confiscates 100 tons of ivory. 100 tons of ivory comes from around 7,000 elephants. Kenya burns the ivory. The Kenyan president sets the ivory on fire. He also talks about the problem. He says that he wants to stop the ivory market. People come to the burning event. There are presidents of other African countries. Not all presidents come, however. Some people say that it is not good to burn ivory. When there is less ivory, the price can go up. There can be more elephant killing, not less.	People burned over 100 tons of ivory in Kenya. The confiscated ivory amounts to the tusks of about 7,000 elephants. Kenya’s president set the eleven big piles of ivory on fire. African leaders and celebrities joined him. The president also gave a speech about the country’s plan to stop the ivory trade, a trade which means death to elephants. Some people, however, do not agree with the burning of ivory. They say that destroying so much ivory could make the price of it go up and cause more elephant killing. Botswana, which is home to about half of Africa’s elephants, is against the burning, and its president did not come to the event.	This is over 100 tons of ivory gone up in flames. Kenya has burnt this seized ivory to show its commitment to saving Africa’s elephants. The country’s president ignited the first of 11 huge  stockpiles in Nairobi National Park, which are expected to burn for several days. He was joined by African leaders, celebrities, and conservationists to watch the pyres being lit. The confiscated ivory amounts to the tusks of about 7,000 elephants. Before igniting the first pyre, Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta spoke: “The height of the pile of ivory before us marks the strength of our resolve . Before you, ladies and gentlemen, is the largest haul of ivory and horn ever to be destroyed in this manner. And our reason is crystal clear – no one, and I repeat again, no one has any business trading in ivory, for this trade means death, death of our elephants and death of our natural heritage .” The burning comes after African leaders meeting in Kenya urged an end to illegal trade in ivory. Experts have warned Africa’s elephants could be extinct within decades. But some conservationists have expressed opposition to the ivory burn Kenya, the biggest in history. They say destroying so much of a rare commodity could increase its value and encourage more poaching rather than less. Botswana, which is home to about half of Africa’s elephants, is opposed to the burn and its president did not attend the event in Nairobi. Demand for ivory comes largely from Asia, with the main trafficking route being through the Kenyan port of Mombasa.
Pope John Paul II visits Ireland in 1979. Around 2.7 million people come to see him. A lot of people in Ireland like the Catholic Church in 1979. However, things change.

Pope Francis visits Ireland this month in 2018. Only 500,000 people come to see him. He talks about the scandals . He is sad about them.	Pope Francis travelled to Ireland last weekend in the first papal visit in 39 years. In 1979, Pope John Paul II drew crowds of 2.7 million. A series of scandals undermined the once-powerful position of the Catholic Church in Ireland. In the 1990s, people found out that hundreds of priests sexually abused thousands of children over many years. The 1990s were also the time when Ireland’s economy grew and opened the country to the world. The abortion referendum and legalising gay marriage also shows Ireland is in change. Pope Francis met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins, and the head of government Leo Eric Varadkar at Dublin castle where they gave a speech. The Pope expressed pain and shame over the scandals and asked for forgiveness .	Pope Francis travelled to Ireland last weekend in the first papal visit to the country since 1979 when Pope John Paul II drew crowds of 2.7 million. The current Pope expected to attract a fraction of that number (around 500,000) due to a series of scandals which undermined the once-powerful position of the Catholic Church. Beginning in the 1990s, a series of criminal cases established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children over decades. Police convicted six Irish priests between 1975 and 2001. The economic boom in the 1990s (which opened up Ireland to the world), the abortion referendum and legalising gay marriage also signalled changes in the nation’s attitude . Pope Francis met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins, and the head of government Leo Eric Varadkar at Dublin castle where they gave a speech. His Holiness expressed pain and shame at the failure of church authorities regarding the scandals. The historic visit to the country ended after the Holy Father attended a Mass in Dublin’s Phoenix Park where he begged forgiveness for the cases of sex abuse.
Tutankhamun was a king of Egypt. This news is about his mask. People found it in 1924. Egyptian masks had beards on them. The beard was not on the mask. It was broken off. People put the beard on the mask in 1941. They used glue. The mask was OK until 2014. In 2014, the beard fell off. People put the beard back. They use glue again. However, people can see the glue. The mask must be fixed . It takes nine weeks to fix the mask. Now, it is fixed. You can see it in the Egyptian Museum.	This news is about the mask of Tutankhamun, Egypt’s famous boy king. The mask was found and brought to the Egyptian Museum in 1924. Egyptian masks had beards on them. Tutankhamun’s beard was unattached to its mask. People reattached the beard to the mask in 1941 with glue. The glue became worse over time, and the beard broke off in 2014. It happened when museum workers accidentally touched the mask. People glued the beard back, but other people could see the glue and put pictures of the mask on the Internet. People had to fix the mask properly. Now, after nine weeks of restoration work , it is back in the museum.	This is the mask of Tutankhamun, Egypt’s famous boy king. The beard broke off in 2014 when museum workers were changing the lights in its display case and accidentally touched the mask. It had been glued back together but needed further repair work after images surfaced online, showing a line of glue around its chin. It was unveiled after nine weeks of restoration work. Egyptian Minister of Antiquities , Mamdouh Eldamaty, announced the beard had never been fixed since the mask was first excavated and brought to the Egyptian Museum with its beard unattached in 1924. It was reattached to the mask in 1941 with glue that had deteriorated over the past 70 years. Eldamaty said they had discovered an additional gold tube inside the beard while restoring the artefact .

It showcases 20 complete bodies alongside numerous organs, bones and tissue which have all been preserved using the plastination technique. The technique was developed by a German anatomist doctor Gunther von Hagens, whereby water and fat are replaced with plastic to prevent  decay . Von Hagens is no stranger to controversy – his televised public autopsy he performed in front of a live audience in 2002 caused a public outrage , as did his online shop selling human and animal body parts when it opened in 2010. The main collection offers visitors the chance to get up, close and personal with the dead, peeking beneath the skin to observe the intricacies of muscles, joints, the digestive system, reproductive organs and all manner of other body parts at  close quarters . And if that’s not interactive enough for, you could one day become part of the project by pledging to donate your body after death.

This year is difficult for airlines . People cannot travel. Planes do not fly. Airlines park planes. Sometimes, more than two thirds of planes are on the ground. It is a very big number. It never happens in the past. Planes are starting to fly again. Some people still worry. They are not sure that planes are safe. Planes need to fly. If they do not fly, they can have many problems. It is possible that their batteries do not work well. Birds and bugs can make nests inside. Another problem is that pilots stay out of work. They can make mistakes. Many small accidents happen this year. Experts say that pilots need to train. They can fly again after they train.	During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big fall in air travel. At the worst point, two thirds of all planes did not fly. Operators parked the planes on runways where they stayed for months. Now, planes are starting to fly again, but many people worry that they are not safe enough. Experts said that there could be technical problems, for example, empty batteries in emergency systems. It is also not clear how airlines maintained the planes which did not fly for a long time. Another problem can be that pilots did not have any training, and they can have problems when they operate a plane. This year, there were many accidents when pilots landed and problems with the right speed or altitude . Experts said that pilots needed to go to train before they could fly with real planes again.	Regulators , insurers, and experts are warning airlines to take extra care when reactivating planes that were left in extended storage during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sudden fall in global air travel meant that an unprecedented number of planes had to be parked on runways. At one point, two thirds of the global fleet were put on the ground. Now, as planes are returning to the skies, regulators worry about maintenance errors, pilots being out of practice, and even insect nests blocking key sensors. This year, there´s been a sharp rise in the number of poor landings, and some of them resulted in crashes. According to European regulators, this year has also seen an alarming rise in incidents involving wrong air speed or altitude readings. Long periods out of service also raise worries, including contaminated fuel and drained batteries in emergency systems.

In May, police kill a Black man in the US. This starts some changes in the film business. Many film companies start to focus on Black people more. Netflix and Disney+ bring more stories about Black people. KweliTV is a streaming company that focuses only on Black artists and films. In the last few months, many people subscribe to KweliTV. The CEO of Kweli is happy. It is good that more people are interested in Black stories. However, viewers are interested not only in Black people in the US. Many people see the movie ´Black Panther´. The movie is about a fictional African country. People start to be interested in Africa. Nollywood is in Africa. It is similar to Hollywood in the US and Bollywood in India. However, African films are not so successful in the world. Money is the biggest problem.	After the death in May of a US Black man, George Floyd, many film companies focused on Black people. Kweli TV is a streaming service that focuses only on Black artists, film, and documentaries. Since April, the number of people who subscribe to KweliTV has doubled. The founder and CEO of KweliTV is very happy. He says that it is great to see so many people interested in Black culture. However, people are not only interested only in the US. The ´Black Panther´ movie is about the fictional African country of Wakanda, and many people got interested in African stories when they saw the movie. However, for African filmmakers, it is not so easy to make a movie that is successful globally . African companies do not get as much money as US or Chinese companies.	Since June, companies like Netflix and Disney+ have been promoting Black stories. KweliTV, a streaming service entirely devoted to Black artists, films, and documentaries, more than doubled its number of subscribers since April. The founder and CEO of KweliTV, DeShuna Spencer, said that it was great seeing so many people wanting to understand Black culture more. However, the growing demand for stories from Black artists does not focus only on the US. The success of ´Black Panther´ and its depiction of the made-up African country also threw a spotlight on stories from Africa. Outside of US films, KweliTV´s largest group of content comes from South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria, which is home to Nollywood. However, despite the massive amount of titles and artists from Africa, there is still a struggle to show films globally, because the films are not supported like Hollywood or the Chinese movie industry.

This news is from the UK. Children have bad teeth there. They eat a lot of processed food. They also drink sweet drinks. All of this is very bad for their teeth. Sometimes, a child’s teeth are very bad. Then the dentist must take the teeth out. Over one year in the UK, dentists took out the teeth of 14,000 children. This costs a lot of money. It is bad for the children. They are going to have problems with their teeth for life. Doctors say that parents must have more information. They must know what is good and what is bad for their children.	A dentist in the UK had to take out all of the baby teeth from a two-year-old child because the teeth were rotten . Unfortunately, that child is not the only one with such problems. It is a whole generation of children in the UK. In one year, dentists had to remove teeth from as many as 14,000 children aged 5 and under. This cost the National Health Service a lot of money and removing baby teeth leads to more problems later in a child’s life. The reason for the children’s rotten teeth is unhealthy food. The children are eating too much processed food and drinking fizzy drinks with a lot of sugar in them. Doctors say that the parents need more information, so they know not what to give their children.	“A few weeks ago, I had to take out all the baby teeth from a two-year-old child and that was heartbreaking, really heartbreaking. We’re a team that’s worked together for a long time but, the atmosphere in the theatre, we were all in silence.” And it’s a whole generation of children with teeth like these that are being removed, often leading to a lifetime of dental problems. “Cavities, ‘ exposured ’ nerves, abscesses …” “And how young children are you seeing this in?” “From the age of 3. And this is going to affect the child for the rest of their lives.” Removing baby teeth often leads to adult ones coming through crowded, meaning yet more chance of decay . New figures show at a cycle that more and more children are being caught in. Children’s rotting teeth is costing the NHS 35 million pounds a year, up more than 60% from 5 years ago. As many as 14,000 children aged 5 and under needed to have teeth removed in 1 year. Caitlin is just one of these children. She needs to have 6 teeth removed. Her mother said she feels let down because she thought she was giving her healthy food. “I was told off because I gave her too much fruit, which I thought was healthy, with sugar-free juice, and fruit snacks. It makes me feel ashamed in a way because I think people probably think, ‘oh, she’s been eating too many sweets, so you’ve not been looking after her teeth.’” “We’ve seen much more processed food, much more drinking of fizzy drinks and drinks that purport to be healthy but actually have large amounts of sugar in them. And what we’re saying is that parents need the information to be able to make really informed choices.” The hope is that with greater information will come better dental habits and end to a generation of young children requiring such extreme dental work.
