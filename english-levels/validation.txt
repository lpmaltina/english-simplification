Many gas stations in the UK have no petrol or gas. The situation is very serious last week. Drivers wait in long lines before the stations. There are not enough truck drivers in the UK.

Gas stations use their petrol reserves now. Reserves are for emergency situations. Soldiers are ready to help. They can drive trucks. Experts say that the situation can go many weeks.	Last week, gas stations across the UK started to run out of petrol or gas. The situation caused chaos in the country, as drivers waited in long lines before gas stations for hours. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the problem was there were not enough truck drivers. Many truck drivers before were not British, and after Brexit, it was more difficult for them to go to the UK. The government said that it would give visas to foreign truck drivers. Johnson said that it was not the best solution for the economy. The government agreed to use petrol reserves because many gas stations had no petrol. Also, soldiers were ready to drive trucks if the situation was even worse. Experts said that it could take weeks before the situation gets back to normal.	After several days of gas stations running out of petrol or gas, long lines of vehicles formed at many stations. The shortage caused chaos across the country, and the government is sending many reserve tankers and putting the army on standby to drive trucks. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed a shortage of truck drivers, and he suggested that it was caused by world economies using petrol as they recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The government announced that it would send thousands of emergency visas to foreign truck drivers to alleviate the crisis; however, Johnson said that migrant workers weren´t the solution, as this would lead to a low-wage and low-skill economy. More than a quarter of the UK service stations have no fuel, and British motorists will have to wait weeks for fuel supply to return to normal.

Iran and other countries sign a deal in 2015. Iran has some uranium. Uranium is a heavy metal. It can be very dangerous. People use it in industry and medicine. Nuclear  power stations make energy from uranium. People use uranium in nuclear weapons , too. Some countries worry that Iran wants to make a nuclear weapon. The deal stops Iran. Iran breaks the deal. The country wants to get more uranium now. Iran says that the uranium is not for nuclear weapons. It is not easy to make a nuclear weapon. The weapon has many parts.

It takes a long time to make a weapon and it has many components which are not easy to make.	Iran seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, and the country also announced that it would increase its nuclear activities. In the final days of Donald Trump´s US presidency, tensions in the region are building up. Iran is revealing details of its plans to produce a stockpile of enriched uranium for its nuclear program; however, the uranium will be used for peaceful purposes. The country restarted production a few days ago in a pushback against the US sanctions. It is the latest breaking of Iran´s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Regional opponents led by Israel say that Iran wants to build nuclear weapons. Iran is enriching uranium to 20% and such a level of purification can be used for medical and energy purposes, as well as weapons. However, even if Iran gains a stockpile of 20% enriched uranium, it would still be a way from getting all the components that are required for a weapon.

More people die from COVID-19 every day. The number of dead people is more than two million now. Some companies make a vaccine against COVID-19. It still takes a long time to vaccinate millions of people. Another problem is that some counties do not have a vaccine. Scientists say that it is very difficult to control the virus. It can take more than five months. It is possible that another million people will die this year. The worst situation is in the US. The number of dead people is 390,000. Other countries with many dead people are Brazil, India, and Mexico.	The number of people who died from COVID-19 reached two million. Unfortunately, scientists do not expect the numbers to go down soon. Some countries started to vaccinate people, but the process is slow, and in some countries, there is not any vaccine available . Therefore, it could be difficult to get the virus under control before summer. Scientists from the University of Washington said that the number of dead people could reach 2.89 million by the end of 2021. Countries with the highest number of dead people are the US, Brazil, India, and Mexico. In the US, almost 390,000 people died from COVID-19 already. COVID-19 already killed more people than malaria and tuberculosis together in 2020.	The world has hit a frightening COVID-19 threshold , with two million people dead and few expectations for the numbers to start dropping any time soon. Vaccination is going slowly in the US, and in some parts of the world, it´s virtually non-existent . Therefore, the odds are slim of controlling the outbreak before the summer at the earliest. Overall, the US is leading all countries in deaths, with nearly 390,000 people, and the next countries in the line are Brazil, India and Mexico. COVID-19 has already killed more people than malaria and tuberculosis combined in the past year. According to scientists from the University of Washington, fewer than one million people will die from COVID-19 this year. The latest analysis projects 2.89 million deaths worldwide by the end of 2021.

To help this situation, an organisation asked the two governments to open the border at the Rio Grande Canal between El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico. The leader of the organisation said that these problems were due to a “broken migration system” and he hoped that the event would make people think about the US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s promises to build a wall between the US and Mexico. The organisation called this event “Hugs Not Walls,” as it was a 3-minute event to open the border and allow families to reunite . It had to be a short event since the border cannot be open for very long.
This news is from England. Some children are in hospital. They are sick. Three window cleaners want to make the children feel better. They put on superhero costumes. They go on top of the hospital. They come down. They are on ropes. The children are sitting near a window. They can see the superheroes through the window. The children are very happy. The window cleaners are happy, too. They like to make the children feel better.	In England, three window cleaners wanted to make sick children in a hospital feel better, so they put on superhero costumes and got ready for a visit. The surprise for the children was when the superheroes rode  down the side of the hospital window. They stopped at the sixth floor above the ground where the children sat by the window. When the window cleaners came in front of the children, the children were excited to see the window cleaners as superheroes. One window cleaner was glad . He said that it was important just to make one child smile.	There is not much fun in being ill, but three window cleaners at the children’s ward of one hospital in London know how to cheer the little patients up. Superman, Batman and Spiderman abseil down the glass building, spreading smiles floor by floor. The superheroes than take pictures with the children. The man dressed as Batman later said that he enjoys the task. In fact, his son (who was dressed as Spiderman) was the superhero’s fan as well, and if he had been in hospital not feeling well, seeing Spiderman would have made his day.
Asimo is a robot . It makes its debut in Belgium. It may help people soon. Asimo can open a bottle and pour a drink. It can also communicate. It knows sign language.

Asimo made its European debut in Belgium. This robot may soon help people in need . It can open a bottle and pour a drink. It can also communicate via sign language. Asimo can respond to people and the environment – it can avoid collisions. The smart robot can also dance. Sadly, its battery lasts only around 40 minutes.	Dancing and hopping its way, as it makes its European debut in Belgium, meet Honda’s latest addition to its humanoid robot family, the dexterous Asimo. It stands for Advanced Step and Innovative Mobility and is eventually intended to help people in various situations in need such as the elderly or all those in disaster zones. “Hello everyone! Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming today.” Asimo is able to open a bottle and pour a drink and express complex sign language. “Sensors in Asimo’s fingers are also needed to pick up the paper cup, as well. It already helps with picking the cup up, but also ensuring that apply too much force.” So we know Asimo can response people and its environment and has the ability of distinguishing voices and avoiding collisions. But throwing shapes on the dance floor won’t last all night long. It can currently only run uncharged for around 40 minutes.
The World Anti-Doping Agency checks that athletes do not dope. To dope is when athletes take drugs which help them get better at a sport. These drugs are not legal. The agency finds out that many Russian athletes dope at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia. A laboratory in Moscow tests Russian athletes. The laboratory changes their results. Russian officials know about it. It is a big scandal . A court stops Russian athletes from all sports events for four years. Another court makes a change last week. Russian athletes can be at sports events. They cannot represent Russia at the next two Olympics. They cannot represent any country. Many world athletes are angry. They think that Russian athletes must not be at the Olympics.	After the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, the World Anti-Doping Agency found out that many Russian athletes took banned drugs. Russian officials knew about the doping and a Moscow laboratory changed the results. A court banned Russia from all sports events for four years. Then last week, another court changed the ban. Russia cannot use its name, flag, and anthem at the next two Olympics and at any world championship in the next two years. Russian athletes can compete, but they cannot officially represent Russia. Their uniforms will say ´ neutral athlete´. Many athletes are angry because they say that this is not a real ban of Russia.	Last year, a four-year old ban was imposed on Russia by the World Anti-Doping Agency after it had discovered that Russian authorities had deliberately erased and manipulated doping data. This way, athletes didn’t get punished for taking banned drugs. However, last week, the ban was reduced. Russia has been banned from using its name, flag, and anthem at next year´s Olympics in Tokyo, at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, and at any world championship for the next two years. However, Russian athletes will be able to compete either as individuals or in national teams in international competitions if they meet strict conditions. Russian teams won´t officially be called Russian teams. ´Russia´ will be printed on their uniforms provided that ´neutral athlete´ appears as well. The decision angered athletes and anti-doping groups who said that Russia hadn’t really been banned. It has been simply rebranded as ´neutral athletes from Russia´.
The Chinese like pale skin. They think that it is pretty. They do not like dark skin. Women want to have pale skin, but they want to go to the beach. They must protect their skin. They wear facekinis to protect their faces. A facekini is a type of swimwear . It protects from the sun and jellyfish . It is very popular.	Pale skin is highly-prized in China. It is seen as delicate and feminine . If you have dark skin, on the other hand, people may think that you work in the fields. That is why women who go to the beach wear facekinis – a swimwear for the face. Facekinis are popular and people have bought over 30,000 facekinis. There might be a little problem though – they scare little children. That is why facekinis now also come in Peking opera designs that Chinese people like.	While dark skin in China is often associated with undesirable tanning caused from farming fields or doing manual labour , pale skin is seen as delicate and feminine and is highly prized. An owner of a swimwear store reacted to customer demand and designed a ‘facekini’ to protect women from getting a tan, as well as to protect them from jellyfish stings. She made her original facekini in 2004 and the business has been developing ever since. In 2014 alone, she sold around 30,000 facekinis. While the facekini has a very loyal following across the country, with the wearers being hailed as trend setters, the designer has faced in an undesirable effect of her garment – it scares small children. That is why she has stopped making white, grey, or dark-coloured facekinis and now makes facekinis with Peking opera designs which Chinese people like.
Giving birth is not easy. It is very painful . Fathers cannot feel the pain. Only mothers can. However, fathers can try it. A hospital in China lets them. A nurse puts special pads on a man’s belly. These pads carry electricity, and the man feels pain. One man says that it feels really painful. He says it is like your organs are pulled apart .	Being a parent isn’t always easy, especially when it comes to giving birth. A hospital in China offers taster sessions for men who are soon going to be fathers. The fathers have the opportunity to feel what it is like for the women to give birth. A nurse places special pads on a man’s belly. These pads carry electric shocks which create a feeling that is similar to giving birth. The session starts with weak shocks, but then the nurse makes them stronger, and the man begins to writhe in pain. One man said that it was really painful. He said it felt like his heart and lungs were being pulled apart.	When it comes to bringing a new life into the world , there are few who would argue that women don’t get the raw end  of the deal . Well, moms, now s hospital in China is giving would-be fathers a chance to get an idea of how it feels to experience one of the tougher aspects of becoming a parent – giving birth. Aima Hospital has decided to offer taster sessions where men can experience something of the pain giving birth. Pads attached to a device are placed above the abdomen carrying electric shocks which the hospital says create a feeling similar to that of giving birth. Once the electric current begins to flow the fathers to-be writhe in agony , as the nurse gradually steps up the intensity of the pain on a scale of 1 to 10. “Basically, it felt really painful. I feel like giving birth to a child is actually really not that easy. I felt like my heart and lungs were being ripped apart. It was basically really painful. You can’t even describe how painful it was.” Compared to Europe and North America, Chinese men are relatively absent from the process of giving birth. Some state-run hospitals still don’t allow men to witness the birth of their children.

In Brazil, it rains a lot. It rains so much that it makes a mudslide happen. The mudslide covers eight people and two houses. Four people die. One person who dies is a grandmother, but her granddaughter doesn’t die. The grandmother puts her arm over her granddaughter. This protects her from the mudslide. People cannot go back to their homes. Mudslides can happen again. Mudslides and landslides happen more and more in Brazil. This is because there are a lot of floods, winds and storms.	In Brazil, a mudslide killed four people after it buried two houses and eight people. A grandmother was one of the people who died and who managed to save her granddaughter by throwing her arm over her. People cannot go back to their homes because of the risk of more mudslides and landslides. Sadly, mudslides are becoming more common in Brazil because of the growing frequency of floods, high winds and storms. Sometimes, it is hard to tell how many people die because of mudslides because people cannot find their bodies under the buildings that fall down.	A mudslide in southeastern Brazil has killed four people when two houses collapsed and eight people were buried after heavy rains. The fatalities include a grandmother who managed to save the life of her one-year-old granddaughter by throwing her arm over her to protect the child. Local media said that the civil defense has banned  residents from returning to 37 homes in the disaster zone  due to a risk of further landslides in the area. In the last few years, the increasing frequency of floods, high winds and storms has become part of the new normal in Brazil with mudslides becoming much too regular an occurrence . Scenes of widespread devastation like this one are not uncommon and the death toll is often hard to predict as bodies remain trapped in the rubble .

People believe that this brings them good luck and protection. The Roman Catholic Church does not like this tradition.	Bolivians have celebrated an ancient tradition rooted in  indigenous practices where people adorn and honor skulls, called Natitas, which they believe bring them good fortune and protection. The Natitas spend most of the year indoors but are traditionally decorated and paraded to the cemetery a week after All Saints’ Day. Friends and family adorn skulls with hats and flowers. They give them food and even cigarettes during the festivities. Even the skulls of unidentified deceased take part in the party. As the afternoon wore on , participants danced to honour the skulls. The Roman Catholic Church does not endorse the practice, but when the cemetery’s parish refused to open its doors to the Day of the Skull believers twelve years ago, they threw stones at the church and broke all the windows. Now the parish is open to believers for a blessing ceremony. The Natitas tradition, a fusion of Catholic and indigenous beliefs, is traditionally practiced by the country’s indigenous groups.
Researchers make a study about dementia. Dementia is a disease in the brain. Researchers say that there will be three times more people with dementia in 2050 than now. Dementia is a disease where people have problems to learn and remember things. They start to forget things. They cannot think clearly. People older than 65 years usually get the disease. Alsoo, obesity , diabetes , or smoking are things that can make dementia more possible. Researchers study the situation in 195 countries. The number of people with dementia is going up everywhere. The situation is more serious in some areas, for example, in South Africa or the Middle East. There are more and more people. The population is getting older. Experts say that 153 million people will have dementia in 2050.	Researchers published a study last week which said that the number of people with dementia would triple by 2050. The study looked at 195 of the world’s countries and territories and it studied current developments in health laws and medications. Researchers said that by 2050, there would be 153 million people with dementia and that the number of cases would go up in all countries. Dementia is a cognitive disease, which means that it changes thinking, learning, understanding, and remembering. There are physical risks to get dementia. Researchers expect that there will be many cases in countries where there is a large population and the population is aging.	According to experts, dementia will ravage the minds of 153 million people globally in 2050, about three times more than in 2019. On Thursday, in the Lancet Public Health Journal, a study looked at 195 of the world’s countries and territories, and it showed the rising numbers for public health laws along with successful therapies from drugmakers. The tripling cases of cognitive illnesses that include Alzheimer’s disease is tied to trends in risk including obesity, diabetes, low education, and smoking. Researchers expect the number of people with dementia to increase in every country globally, regardless of the region. The projections in North Africa and the Middle East are quite large, and it is due to large increases in both population growth and population aging. In Europe and the western world, there is a decrease in the numbers of some dementias, such as vascular dementia, due to the support by health laws. Healthy diets, less alcohol, and stopping smoking are key parts to manage the risk for dementia.

Police in Central America have a problem. Poachers take turtle eggs from the sand at the beach. They sell the eggs. It is against the law. However, some people like to eat turtle eggs. They believe that turtle eggs are something special to eat. Scientists have an idea. They make fake eggs. The eggs look like real eggs. They are soft and smooth. However, they have a GPS inside. Scientists make a test. They put 101 eggs in the sand. Poachers find 25 of them. Scientists can track the eggs. Most eggs stay in the area. However, some eggs end up more than 80 miles away. The result of the test is good. Scientists hope that fake eggs can help local police.	Scientists in Central America found a new way to fight with illegal business with turtle eggs. Scientists made fake eggs and they put the eggs in the sand at the beach. The eggs were printed on a 3D printer, and they looked like real turtle eggs. However, there was GPS technology inside. Scientists put 101 eggs in the sand, and poachers found 25 eggs. Poachers then sold the eggs to smugglers . Scientists could see where the eggs went. Most eggs stayed in the area; however, some eggs ended up in a supermarket that was 85 miles away. Scientists only tested the eggs; however, they hope that in the future, fake eggs could help police in the fight with poachers.	Conservationists have developed a new method to track the trafficking of turtle eggs in Central America where eggs are smuggled from beaches and sold as delicacy . The eggs are 3D printed egg decoys with hidden GPS tracking technology. Currently, conservationists are testing if it is possible to put an egg in a nest and to trace the entire trade chain. The eggs were made as realistic as possible, and in total 101 eggs were placed in nests throughout the project with 25 eggs taken by poachers. It revealed that the majority of eggs did not leave the local area; however, conservationists were able to track eggs that ended up in a supermarket about 85 miles away. No legal action was taken as a result of the project, although the team is working towards making these decoy eggs a tool that police could use to combat illegal trade with turtle eggs.

This week, scientists come up with a new study. The study is about Greenland. Greenland is the biggest island in the world. It is full of ice. However, something bad is happening. The ice is melting . It is turning into water. Last year, 586 billion tons of Greenland´s ice melt. It is a lot of ice. It is the same amount as 140 trillion gallons of water. It is not easy to imagine the amount. Greenland´s ice increases the world´s sea level by 0.06 inches last year. It is a very big number. Scientists say that climate change is the main problem. Our planet is getting warmer. Ice is melting. It is a problem for countries that are close to the sea. Some islands will be under water in the future.	This week, scientists said that Greenland lost 586 billion tons of ice last year. It was a new record, and Greenland is melting faster than ever before. 586 billion tons of ice are 140 trillion gallons of water. It is not easy to imagine the amount; however, scientists say that it would be enough to cover the US state of California in more than four feet of water. Scientists believe that melting ice is the result of climate change . It is a dangerous situation for some parts of the world because when the ice melts, the sea level rises. Scientists say that some islands will disappear under water. Last year, water from Greenland´s ice added 0.06 inches to the world´s sea level. Maybe you think that it is not so much water; however, when you imagine how big our world is, the number is really big.	Researchers say that Greenland lost a record amount of ice last year – 586 billion tons. A new study says that such an amount would be enough to cover the US state of California in more than four feet of water and that equals 140 trillion gallons. Greenland is melting faster than ever, and the latest record has shattered 2012´s record. Scientists say that this is a direct consequence of climate change. The melting ice contributes to a rise in the sea level, which could lead to dangerous flooding along coastlines. Last year, Greenland´s melt alone added 0.06 inches to global sea level rise. That may not seem like much; however, according to scientists, it is an astounding number, when you consider how huge our world is.
The coronavirus is in many countries. People must stay in their homes. They spend a lot of time in front of their TV or computer. It is not good for the eyes. Experts say that our eyes can get tired. We do not blink so often when we stare at a screen. Our eyes get dry and red. We cannot see well. We have headaches. It is good to follow a 20-20-20 rule. When we look at a screen for 20 minutes, we should look away for 20 seconds. It is good to look at something 20 feet away. Then our eyes can relax. Reading glasses can also help. Eye drops help tired eyes, too.	People are spending a lot of time in front of their TVs and computers. The reason is the coronavirus, which makes people stay at home. Experts say that more screen time can make our eyes tired. When we stay too close to the screen, we do not blink so often. We miss 2 – 3 blinks every minute, which makes 120 – 180 blinks in one hour. Our eyes get dry and red, we cannot see well, and we can have headaches. There is a 20-20-20 rule that can help our eyes. When we look at a screen for 20 minutes, we should take a break and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. It is also possible to buy reading glasses or eye drops at a drugstore to help our eyes.	People are spending more time in front of their screens, and experts say that it could damage our eyes. Due to the lockdown, people have been watching more streaming platforms, scrolling through social media, and video chatting 10 – 15% more than last month. When we stay too close to the screens, we tend to stare more and not blink, which has a cumulative  effect on the eyes. We miss 2 – 3 blinks a minute, which makes 120 – 180 missed blinks in a one-hour Zoom meeting. It can cause a lot of discomfort in the eyes, burning redness, blurred vision , and headaches. One thing that can help combat the extra eye strain is the 20-20-20 rule. It means that when we look at a screen for 20 minutes, we should take a break and look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Over-the-counter reading glasses and artificial tears can help, too.
In the US, fires burn in the west. Also, hurricanes hit the east. However, extreme weather is more and more usual in all of the world. Scientist think that human activity brings more extreme weather. The planet is getting warmer. A study finds that people are responsible for 97% of fires in the US. Warmer temperatures mean more fires. The fires start very easily. They are bigger. It is harder to stop them. Warmer temperatures also make more hurricanes . The hurricanes are stronger. It is more common that they get the land. They break up houses. They kill people, too. Scientists expect more hurricanes this year. The hurricane season ends on November 30 th .	In the past months, wildfires have burned a large part of the US West Coast. On the other side of the country, hurricanes hit the East Coast. Many scientists believe that human activity is the reason why the weather is getting more extreme . A recent study by the University of Colorado found that people were responsible for starting 97% of wildfires in the past twenty years. Human activity has caused warmer temperatures, and warmer temperatures mean more fires. Also, the fires are more dangerous because it is more difficult to stop them. Scientists think that warmer tempertures cause more hurricanes, too. In the past twenty years, hurricanes have become stronger. It is more usual that hurricanes reach the land, and they cause a lot of damage.	Wildfires on the US West Coast have burned more than five million acres, and on the US East Coast, hundreds of homes are flooded in Florida after Hurricane Sally made landfall . Some scientists believe that people play a role in wildfires, and the majority of fires are human-caused. A recent study found that humans were responsible for starting 97% of home-threatening wildfires between 1992 and 2015 in the US. Warming temperatures are a result of human activities, and they mean that fires are going to keep getting worse and more aggressive . Scientists also think that hurricanes in a warmer climate are going to have higher rainfall rates, and they will become more intense . Looking at global data since the late 1970s, there was an increase in storms that reached Category 3 or higher.

This news is from the Netherlands. People are at a port . They work there. They find a ship in the water. The ship is very old. It is from the 15th century. It is 20 metres long and 8 metres wide. It is 40 tons heavy. People used the ship for trade in the Baltic and North Seas. This ship is very old, but it looks good. Experts are very happy. They put a special box around the ship. They pick the ship up.	Construction workers in a Dutch port discovered a 15th-century ship. The metal used in the ship’s body kept it well-preserved. Archaeologists are excited about the ship because they usually don’t find ships so well preserved. The boat is 20 metres long and 8 metres wide. It weighs 40 tons. People used the ship for trade in the Baltic and North Seas. Experts put the wreck into a special case and brought it up. They will keep it at a centre where people will take good care of it.	A piece of history emerged from the deep this week when archaeologists raised a medieval ship from a Dutch riverbed where it had lain beneath undisturbed for half a millennium. Construction workers happened upon the discovery during an underwater investigation whilst preparing to excavate the port. The discovery of the 15th-century ship in such a well-preserved state has excited maritime historians used to finding mere  fragments of disintegrated  vessels . The ship is believed to have been a cog, a medieval trading vessel, which used to sail the Baltic and North Seas. Built with metal joints , the wreck is sturdier than other contemporary finds, leaving them free to raise it from the water without fears it would break apart. They encased the 20-metre by 8-metre boat in a specially constructed metal frame, raising all 40 tons from the water with the help of experienced divers. The delicate remains will be kept at the Newell and Heritage Centre in a specially designed station keeping it wet at all times. They hope the preservation of the vessel will allow future generations of maritime enthusiasts to appreciate the craftsmanship of the past.
This happens in England. Someone has fifteen kittens . The person does not want them. The person dumps the kittens. We don’t know the person’s name. One organisation helps animals. This organisation helps ten of the kittens. The other five are safe, too. The kittens are not well. They are full of parasites . We hope that they will go to good homes.	Somebody in England dumped fifteen kittens in a suitcase. All of them are about six weeks old. We don’t know who dumped the kittens because there was no security camera. The kittens are probably not from one litter because there are so many of them. An organisation which helps animals is taking care of ten of the kittens. The rest is at a private boarding establishment . Right now, the poor kittens are full of parasites, but we hope that they will go to good homes.	Fifteen kittens are looking for a new home after they were found dumped in a suitcase in Southampton. The kittens, all aged about just six weeks old, were spotted by a member of the public at about 8.30am on Friday, after someone pulled up in a car and dumped the open suitcase before driving off. The RSPCA is now appealing for information to find out who is responsible for abandoning them outside an animal charity hospital. It’s not clear if the kittens are all from the same litter , and the RSPCA believes it’s more likely that the cats are made up of two that have been dumped together, as there are so many of them. Unfortunately there’s no CCTV  footage of the area which means there’s no description of the person who dumped the adorable cats. Ten of the kittens are now being cared for by the RSPCA while five others are currently at a private boarding  establishment . The poor little kittens are also teeming with fleas and worms, but hopefully they will go to good homes.

I want to put you back in your place.” “So why are you dressed like that?” “Why? Because I want to dress like that. It’s not because…“ The abuse towards Ahlam Saed, all because she’s wearing a veil , continues for five minutes. “I know a white girl who married a Muslim dude and she had a photo of ISIS flag on her back wall.” Forcing the 25-year-old to defend herself. “You know, you are ignorant, you need to grow up and stop teaching kids that!” She says she faces Islamophobia on a regular basis. “He’s one of many, it just goes to show that the ignorant and the people who are close-minded are the loudest and they’re the ones who are most heard in society when it shouldn’t be. I told him, ‘I am recording you,’ and I made him aware I am going to put it on Facebook. He didn’t seem fazed by that.” “Who are you? I’ve lived there all my life! Who the f..k are you?” “I haven’t lived here all my life?!” What happened in this small shop in Shepherd’s Bush has been viewed well over 100,000 times on the Internet. Ahlam says the media’s portrayal of Islam is negative and one-sided and ultimately fuels this type of abuse. “The media need to be very careful of what they give out there and they need to show both sides to the story. The man in that video only takes his information off the media. Had he’ve taken his information from people like myself or general people of the public or Muslims, he would understand that. You know, Muslims are normal people. You know, what doesn’t break you makes you stronger at the end of the day, and it doesn’t make me want to take off my veil. You know, it doesn’t make me want to think about what I wear and, you know, reconsider. I will still be who I am.” “Why are you recording me?” Police are now looking for the man responsible. Ahlam says filming it was a gut reaction . She says she wanted to highlight this one experience. One of many.

In Ancient Egypt, bodies were mummified . A mummified body stays good for a long time. There is a show in the Manchester Museum. You can see the mummies of animals. Some of them are special. One crocodile has 8 heads!	Mummification was a practice in Ancient Egypt. People used it to preserve dead bodies. The Manchester Museum put together an exhibition . It shows that Egyptians also included animals in their practice. Some of the pieces on show are a little strange. One mummified crocodile has 8 heads. Egyptians often used images of animals to communicate with the gods. They also created animal mummies and small bronze statues as gifts to the gods.	The Ancient Egyptian practice of mummification led to dead bodies being preserved. And now the Manchester Museum has put together an exhibition showing how the Egyptians also included animals in that practice.

This news is about the moon. There was a full moon on the 2nd of July. There also was a full moon on the 31st of July. Sometimes, the moon can look blue. When a volcano erupts , the moon can look blue. In 1883, Krakatoa exploded. It was a big volcano. There was a blue moon almost every day. The moon can also look red. This happens when the moon is close to the ground.	There was a full moon on the 2 nd of July and on the 31st of July. According to modern folklore , when there are two full moons in a month, the second one is blue. However, this is not exactly true. Blue moons can happen, but there must be a volcanic eruption. Back in 1883, people saw blue moons almost every night after the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded. Some of the volcanic ash worked as a blue filter. On the other hand , the moon can also get red when it is low in the sky.	When someone says to you,” Yeah, once in a blue moon,” you know what they mean – rare, absurd, or pretty much never going to happen. Well, stop right there because this year it means the end of July! For the second time this month, the moon is about to become full. There was one on the 2nd  of July and now a second is coming on July 31st. According to modern folklore, when there are two full moons in a month, the second one is blue. Most blue moons look pale grey and white just like the moon you see on any other night. Simply squeezing a second full moon into a calendar month doesn’t exactly change its colour. Nevertheless, on rare occasions, the moon can turn blue. According to NASA, a truly blue moon usually requires a volcanic eruption. It says back in 1883, for example, people saw blue moons almost every night after the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded. Some of the plumes of ash were apparently filled with particles that were one micron wide, about the same as the wavelength of red light. Particles of this size strongly scatter red light whilst allowing blue light to pass through. Krakatoa’s clouds then acted like a blue filter. This was also the case with the number of other eruptions, and forest fires can do the same trick. On the other hand, though, tomorrow’s moon could turn red. Often, when the moon is low, it looks red for the same reason that sunsets are red. NASA explains that the atmosphere is full of aerosols much smaller than the ones injected by volcanoes. These aerosols scatter blue light whilst leaving the red behind.

Despite the lack of friends, Nokdo provides a better playground for the last children than big cities. The island has no traffic, it isn´t noisy, and the air is clean. The children can play outside more actively and they like it there.

The coronavirus changes peoples´ lives. They cannot go to shops, cinemas, or restaurants. They must follow strict rules. However, Sweden´s rules are very different.

Swedish people welcomed this approach ; however, the data is not pleasing. The country has experienced many more COVID-19 deaths than other northern European countries. Experts say that it is too early to evaluate the impacts on the society and economy, and it is necessary to wait at least one year to be able to judge which countries dealt with the coronavirus the best.

Competitors went toe to toe to battle it out, and it’s a bit more complex than it looks. “You’ve just got to get the other person’s ankle to touch, or toes, to touch the other side of the board. You start on the same line, you can shuffle once you’ve started, but your foot has to stay on the board in-between the lines, and you’ve just got to touch the side.” The fancy footwork, which took place at Bentley Brook Inn in Derbyshire, saw reigning world champion Alan “Nasty” Nash returning for the 11 th time. “Everybody thinks you’ve got to have big toes, but short, stubby toes – that’s what’s best. I prefer the long toes coming up against me because they snap easier.” And if that wasn’t bizarre enough, the world shin-kicking championships also took place in the Cotswolds. Over the last four centuries, brave competitors have stuffed their trousers with straw before attempting to kick each other until one of them falls over.

Scientists notice a signal . The signal is in space. It is 240 million light years away from the Earth . The signal is special. Scientists don’t know its origin . However, scientists are happy about the signal. It proves that dark matter exists. Eighty-five per cent of space can be from dark matter. Dark matter does not send out light. It also does not take in light. The signal is very interesting. Scientists want more information.	Astronomers detected a mysterious signal. They picked it up in the Perseus Cluster, which is 240 million light years away from the Earth. The scientists don’t yet know the origin of the signal. However, it is already the best evidence of dark matter. Astronomers believe that dark matter forms 85 per cent of the universe. It does not emit or absorb light like other things in space. The detection of the signal excites people, but we need more data to prove dark matter exists.	Astronomers have detected a mysterious signal 240 million light years away from Earth. The unidentified signal is a spike of intensity at a very specific wavelength of X-ray light, but scientists don’t yet know what the origin is. Picked up in the Perseus Cluster, one of the biggest objects in the universe, the discovery is said to be the best evidence of dark matter yet. Astronomers believe dark matter constitutes 85 per cent of the matter in the universe, but doesn’t emit or absorb light like normal matter, such as protons or electrons. These are known to make up the familiar elements seen in planets, stars, and galaxies. Researchers suggest the intensity coming from the Perseus Cluster could be a signature from the decay of a ‘sterile neutrino,’ which are a hypothetical type of neutrino thought to interact with normal matter via gravity. But, while holding exciting potential, the results must be confirmed with additional data to rule out other explanations and to see whether it’s plausible that dark matter has been observed.

The Palace of Westminster is in London. It is old. It was built in the 19th century. It has damage . It must be renovated . There are five plans. The cheapest plan is 3.5 billion pounds. The most expensive plan is 5.7 billion pounds. The MPs must say which plan to choose. If they choose the cheap plan, they cannot be in the building for 6 years.	In London, the Palace of Westminster was rebuilt in the mid-1800s following a fire. Now, in the 21st century, it needs renovations . The stonework is falling apart, roofs are leaking and the plumbing is failing. There are five possible solutions to this problem. The cheapest would cost 3.5 billion pounds, but the MPs would have to move out for six years. The most expensive solution would cost 5.7 billion pounds and take 32 years to complete. The Commons and Lords will have to vote within the next few years on what to do to solve their potential housing problem.	Restoration work on the Houses of Parliament could cost as much as 5.7 billion pounds and take 32 years to complete.

An independent report found other problems including crumbling stonework, leaking roofs and failing plumbing. The Palace of Westminster was rebuilt on the banks of the River Thames in the mid-1800s following a fire. Many of its features have never undergone major renovation since. A world heritage site, the building incorporates the tower of Big Ben and the oldest building on the site, Westminster Hall. The report warns the building could suffer “major, irreversible damage” without significant restoration work. Listing five solutions, the cheapest option would involve moving parliamentarians out of the building entirely for six years. Some MPs have welcomed the idea. “I think we’ve got to be pragmatic and practical. Whatever is the most sensible solution to preserving the historic heritage that we have, not just for the sake of MPs who work here, or members of the House of Lords or the staff but just for the country because it’s such an iconic building.” But others insist they should remain in Westminster. “My view is that we should seek to avoid moving away from here. We need to stay in the heart of Westminster where our democracy is based. But of course we’ve got to do it in the way that makes it possible to get the job done.” The Commons and Lords will have to vote within the next few years on what to do to solve their potential housing problem.

Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country. It is in the Middle East. Saudi women are not as free as women in the West. Each woman must have a guardian . The guardians tell women what they can or cannot do. For example, a woman must ask her guardian if she can get a job. Some people want to change this system. Some people want to keep it. Now, there are some laws which will help women be a little freer. Soon women will be able to leave Saudi Arabia. They will not have to ask their guardians. However, the women must be 21 or older.	In Saudi Arabia, women are treated as minors , which means that they cannot do everything that men can do. Every woman in Saudi Arabia has a male guardian who tells her what she can and cannot do. For example, Saudi women cannot get a job without asking their guardians. However, the country is changing, and some Saudis want to change the guardianship laws and some do not. The Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that he is trying to find a middle ground between these two groups. New laws are going to give more freedom to women. For example, women older than 21 will be allowed to travel outside the country without telling their guardians.	In Saudi Arabia, women are treated as minors , and they must ask their male guardians first when they want to do some things.

He said: ‘Saudis don’t want to lose their identity, but we want to be part of the global culture. We want to merge our culture with the global identity.’ In a series of tweets, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador said that the country will put in place laws which will change women’s status for the better. For example, with those laws women older than 21 will be allowed to travel outside the country without telling their guardians.
World leaders meet in the UK last week. They speak about climate change. Climate change is a big change in the world´s weather. People know about it around the 1950s. Scientists believe the people make big changes on climate change. Antonio Guterres is the Secretary-General of the United Nations. He speaks to world leaders. He says that they must work harder. They must stop climate change. Countries must reduce  emissions . Richer countries must help poorer countries. Many countries reduce emissions since 2015. It is not enough. They must reduce more emissions by 2030. This year´s summer is full of natural  disasters . There are wildfires, floods , and big storms in many parts of the world. The situation is very serious. There will be another meeting in Scotland in six weeks. World leaders must decide what to do.	United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and more than 35 other world leaders. Guterres said that world leaders did not work hard enough to stop climate change . He said that it was necessary to lower emissions and to help poorer countries make cleaner energy. This year´s summer was full of natural disasters. Wildfires destroyed a large part of the US and floods hit the US, China, and Europe, too. There were cyclones in places where they never were before. Guterres said that it was necessary to lower emissions by 45% by 2030. The latest numbers show that countries lowered emissions, but it was not enough. If the situation stays as it is now, the emissions will grow by 16% in 2030.	Last week, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hosted a meeting with 35 to 40 world leaders to get countries to make deeper cuts of emissions, to give poorer countries more money to develop cleaner energy, and to adapt to the worsening impacts of climate change. These meetings are leading up to the huge climate meetings in Scotland in six weeks, and they´re designed to be the next step after the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The focus on climate change comes at the end of another summer of disasters related to extreme weather, including devastating wildfires in the western US; deadly flooding in the US, China and Europe; a stroke of killer tropical cyclones worldwide; and unprecedented heatwaves everywhere. Guterres pushed world leaders to do more for climate change, saying that to keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, it was necessary to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and then to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Instead, the agreements made until now by countries suggest there can be an increase of 16% in emissions in 2030 compared to 2010.

Calais is in the north of France. There is a refugee camp there. The living conditions in this camp are bad. An Englishman is in the camp. He is an ex-soldier. He sees the situation. He feels sorry for the refugees. He plays with a refugee girl. She is from Afghanistan. She is in the camp with her father. The girl and her father want to go to England. The father asks the Englishman for help, and he helps them. He takes the girl with him. However, French police stop him. They find the girl in his car. The man is in trouble.	An English ex-soldier was in the Calais refugee camp in France. He was playing with a little girl who fled Afghanistan with her father. The girl and her father have family in England and wanted to go there. The Afghan refugee asked the Englishman to hide his daughter in his car and take her to England. The ex-soldier saw the horrible situation in the camp, and he decided to help the little girl. However, French police stopped him, and the man is now in trouble for helping illegal immigration. He could go to jail or receive a fine of up to £20,000 by a French court.	“Where are you?” It’s a touching moment not often seen in Calais’s infamous  jungle camp; a volunteer aid worker playing hide-and-seek with this little girl and her father. The pair fled Afghanistan with the hopes of one day reaching the UK to claim asylum . But now, Rob Lawrie could face five years in jail for allegedly attempting to illegally smuggle 4-year-old Baha into the country. “She’s just a sweet little child that you just think, ‘How the hell can you leave her in this situation?’” The former soldier claims the little girl’s father begged him to hide her in his car and drive her to relatives in Yorkshire. “Rational thought left my mind. I’ve got a sleeping compartment in my van, and I said to her dad, ‘Okay, I can’t leave her here, I’m sorry. I’ll take her to your family in England’ who, ironically , live five miles from me.” But he was stopped by French police at the border and charged with aiding illegal immigration. Baha was returned to Calais, while Rob waits to hear if he will be jailed or fined up to £20,000 by a French court. “Well, it’s petrifying . I mean, this has cost me, all being my own fault – don’t get me wrong, I’m not blaming anyone, it’s my fault – it’s cost me my family, it’s cost me financially, I’m virtually bankrupt now.” Online petitions have attracted thousands of signatures in the hope he’ll be spared jail. He hopes his plight will highlight the suffering of migrant children stuck on European borders.
IVF is a type of fertilisation . This fertilisation happens outside the body. Doctors fertilise an egg with sperm . Then, they put it into a female body. It is easy to do this with human eggs and sperm, but it is not easy with dogs. Dogs have different bodies. After 40 years of trying, experts can now do this with dogs, too. This is an important moment in science. Baby dogs are born to one female dog, but she is not their mother. Each little dog has a different mom and dad.	In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a fertilisation which takes place outside the body. Doctors fertilise the egg with sperm, and then they put it into a female body. IVF has assisted in human births since the 1970’s, but scientists could not do this with dogs for a long time. The dog’s reproductive system is very different from other animals. After 40 years of research , the first puppies to be born though IVF were born in the USA. This is an important moment in science because this can help us explain some genetic disorders .	Rarely is a major scientific breakthrough so darn cute – this is the first litter of puppies born through IVF . The seven puppies were born on July 10th and their birth marks over 40 years of research from Cornell University in New York State and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. “This is the world’s first litter of puppies ever born by in vitro fertilisation. So we have seven normal happy healthy puppies. You’ll see that this one here is a cross between a cocker spaniel and and a beagle, whereas this one over here is beagle beagle and they all came from the same litter but they have different moms and dads, but they were all born at the same time and were raised together. Yes, I like you too!” The IVF process sees eggs fertilise outside the body before the embryos are implanted into a female. This has been used since the 1970’s to assist in human birth, but scientists have long struggled to reproduce those results with dogs in part because the canine reproductive system differs a lot from other mammals. The discovery could also help humans in more direct ways by shedding light on the genetic basis for numerous disorders that affect both dogs and humans. Dogs share more than 350 similar inheritable disorders and traits with humans, almost twice as many as any other species , but these guys might be just that little bit cuter!

A bionic arm is not a real arm. It is mechanical . It works almost as well as a real arm. It changes a person´s life. A person does not need so much help from other people if he has this arm. He can play games or ride a bike. He can tie his shoes. Campbel Arid gets his bionic arm in 1998. He is the first person in the world who gets it. His arm weighs 1.8 kilograms. It uses a battery. Now the technology is changing very quickly. Today´s bionic arm reads signals from a person´s muscles . Scientists believe that the technology will change soon. New technology will read a person´s mind.	Scottish hotel owner Campbel Aird got the world´s first bionic arm in 1998. The arm weighed 1.8 kilograms, and it used a battery. With the new hand, Aird could do some things which he was not able to do before, for example, tie his shoes. Since that time, the technology changed very much and changed people´s lives too. People with the new arm became more independent because they did not need the help of others with some simple tasks. Their lives improved greatly, and they could play games or ride bikes. Nowadays, a bionic arm reads signals from a person´s muscles. Special sensors detect electric signals which a person´s limb naturally makes. Scientists believe that next year people will be able to control the bionic arm only by the mind.	In August 1998, Scottish hotel owner Campbel Aird received the world´s first bionic arm. The 1.8-kilogram battery-powered device enabled the man to tie his shoelaces again. Since then, the technology rapidly evolved, giving people a lot of hope and independence. 11-year-old John became the youngest person in Australia to receive an advanced multi-grip bionic arm, made from 3D printing. He could use his hand to do things that he couldn´t have done without it, such as playing chess. Mady Gardner rode a bike for the first time, sitting straight up, and her parents watched her with joy. 11-year-old Bella Tadlock received an R2-D2-style bionic arm, and she was excited to be able to use her fingers again. A bionic arm works by picking up signals from a person´s muscles. When the person puts on his bionic arm and moves muscles in their residual limb just below the elbow, special sensors detect tiny naturally created electric signals. This cutting-edge technology is still evolving, and within the next year, amputees could be able to control their bionic arms with their thoughts.
An organization does a study . Experts talk to over 450,000 people in 10 European countries. They do this from 1992 to 2000. Their study finds that drinking a lot of soda is very bad for people’s health. The study finds that it is bad to drink more than two glasses of soda a day. The soda can lead to diseases which can kill people. Experts say that it is unhealthy to drink a lot of soda for anyone. You can be skinny. You can be a non-smoker. Soda can still lead to some diseases.	A new study found that drinking soda leads to a greater risk for many causes of death. The study surveyed over 450,000 people in 10 European counties from 1992 to 2000. The study found that people who drank two or more glasses of soda a day had higher chances of dying from certain diseases, and people who drank less than one glass of soda a day had less chances. Experts said that drinking a lot of soda shows that you can have an unhealthy lifestyle. However, the study’s results were the same whether you were skinny, overweight, smoked, or did not smoke cigarettes.	A new study discovered that regular soda drinking leads to an increased risk for many causes of death. The study surveyed more than 450,000 people in 10 European countries from 1992 to 2000. The study discovered that people who drank two or more glasses of soda a day had higher chances of dying from certain diseases than people who drank less than one glass of soda a day. Soda sweetened from sugar linked to more digestive diseases, and soda sweetened from artificial sugar linked to more circulatory diseases. Also, drinking any soda excessively is linked to the Parkinson’s disease. Researchers said that drinking a lot of soda suggests that you might have an unhealthy lifestyle, but the results were the same whether you were skinny, overweight, smoked, or did not smoke cigarettes.

However, Airwars, a non-profit company monitoring civilian harm from air strikes, reports that the number of civilian deaths from US-led coalition actions in Iraq and Syria could be as high as 11,637. That number could still be higher because the agency counts deaths which were deemed confirmed or fair.

NASA finds seven new planets. They are as big as the earth . They are 40 light years away. They orbit a small star. The star’s name is TRAPPIST-1. It is smaller than Jupiter. Three of the seven planets are interesting. There could be water on them. There could be life, too.	NASA discovered seven earth-sized planets. They are 40 light years away and they orbit a nearby star. Its name is TRAPPIST-1. It a dwarf star and it is smaller than Jupiter. There could be water and life on three of the planets, but people must study their atmospheres first.	NASA and a Belgian-led research team announced the discovery of seven earth-sized planets orbiting a nearby star. The cluster of planets is 40 light years away in the constellation Aquarius. The cluster circles tightly around a dim  dwarf star called TRAPPIST-1, which is barely the size of Jupiter. Three of the planets are in the so-called habitable zone where water and possibly life might exist, but people must study their atmospheres first to determine whether the planets could support some form of life.
Apple is a big American company. It is a computer company. It has a lot of money. In August, it has $1 trillion. However, business is smaller now. This news is a shock to business people. Apple’s boss says that the business is smaller because people in China do not buy many new iPhones. The Chinese economy is not growing as fast as before. Some people say that the business is smaller because Apple products are expensive .	In August, Apple became the first American company to be worth $1 trillion. Now, however, Apple said that it will make less money than before, and this is a shock to business people. Apple’s boss said that this is because people are buying fewer iPhones in China. After a lot of growth , China’s economy is slowing down . People say that 2018 will be the year of the slowest growth in China in the last 30 years. The Chinese are more careful with their money, so people buy less. For example, car companies and coffee companies also have fewer sales than before. Other experts say that Apple products are expensive. Apple’s boss also said that people do not upgrade their iPhones as often as they did in the past.	In August, Apple became the first ever American public company to reach a $1 trillion evaluation . However, Apple announced a reduced revenue outlook recently which came as a shock to the stock market . Apple’s CEO Tim Cook said that slow sales in China could cause the drop in value. After a lot of growth, experts say that China is facing an economic slowdown and 2018 is projected to have China’s slowest growth since 1990. With Chinese consumers more careful about how they spend their money, Apple is not the only company to face the consequences . Western car companies and Starbucks, for example, are finding it harder to sell in China. Other analysts blame the situation on Apple’s expensive pricing strategy. The frequency with which people upgrade their iPhones is lower, as well.
Volkswagen is in trouble. It cheats . It puts special software in its cars. If you drive normally, the emissions controls are off. This means that the emissions are high. If you test the car, the emissions controls are on. The car shows that the emissions are low. This is a lie. The emissions are not low. They are too high. Volkswagen must pay a lot of money. It can pay up to 18 billion dollars.	Volkswagen is in trouble, and it could soon have to pay up to 18 billion dollars. Volkswagen skirted American clean air laws. Volkswagen installed a special piece of software into its diesel cars. In the USA, there are around 500,000 of these cars which have this software. This software is not on when you drive normally. It is on when the car is undergoing an emissions test. When the test happens, the emissions look low. This, however, is a lie. The emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO) are 40 times worse than they should be.	Volkswagen is facing billions of dollars in fines after it emerged that around 500,000 of its diesel cars sold in the United States since 2008 carry software that dramatically reduces nitrogen oxide emissions during testing. The US Environmental Protection Agency said Volkswagen had intentionally  skirted American clean air laws by using a piece of software that turns off emissions controls when driving normally and turns them on when the car is undergoing an emissions test. It said on Twitter the cars under investigation emit up to 40 times the national standard for nitrogen oxide which is linked to asthma and lung illnesses. It’s reported that the car maker could now face a fine of up to 18 billion dollars but the EPA said the violations do not present a safety hazard and the cars remain legal to drive and to sell. A US Volkswagen spokesman said the company is co-operating with the EPA’s investigation.
A winter storm is in California, US. Heavy rain and snow bring a lot of water. Drainage pipes cannot take all the water to the ground. Some water flows onto a highway . Water damages the highway.

People cannot do anything about it because nature is strong.	A section of iconic Highway 1 in California, US, collapsed into the ocean on Friday. It was washed out by a winter storm that brought heavy rain and snow. According to officials, a debris flow overwhelmed drainage infrastructure from the hillside above the highway. It then flowed across the highway and eroded the road, which resulted in a complete loss of a part of the highway. The accident happened about 24 kilometers south of Big Sur, a mountainous stretch of California´s Central Coast. The California Department of Transportation declared a state of emergency in two counties in a response to winter storms that threatened to cause mud and debris flows, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents. According to the department, the highway is prone to rock fall and slides, and it is the nature of a road that is built on the edge of a continent where forces of the hillside and the oceans are always at play .

In the UK, people write their laws on vellum. Vellum is made from animal skin. Some people do not like this. They say that paper is enough. Paper is also cheaper. However, vellum can last for 5,000 years. Laws are important. Maybe, they should be on something special. There is a law. It is 801 years old. It is called the Magna Carta. The UK still has it. It is so old that it costs 6 pounds a century to make.	In the UK, people traditionally write laws on vellum. Vellum is made from animal skin. Some people think that paper is a cheaper option. Vellum, however, has its supporters . Vellum can last 5000 years. Laws of countries are important, powerful and they change our lives. Some people think that laws should be written on a long-lasting medium . In 1215, people wrote a very important law. They called it the Magna Carta and today the UK still has it. The Magna Carta is so old, it costs six pounds for every century.	Traditionally, people write British laws on vellum , which is animal skin. Now t he House of Lords is split on whether to stick to this tradition or to seek a cheaper option. A conservative MP said that they laws ought to have a permanency to them, as they are important and powerful, and therefore they ought to be recorded in such a way that they will last for as long as possible. While 80,000 pounds a year for the vellum may sound like a lot of money, the manager of the company which supplies the vellum explained that the long-term costs are very low. The Magna Carta , which is an important document from 1215, has cost only six pounds a century. Moreover, vellum can last up to 5,000 years!
Scientists make a new robot. This robot is special. It can build itself. The building takes five minutes, but the robot does not need help. It can walk at 5 centimetres per second. This technology can build machines. It can help in dangerous places like space. The “origami robot” is cheap. You can make it from common materials. One robot costs less than $100.	American scientists created a new robot. When they apply heat to it, the robot builds itself in under five minutes and walks at 5 centimetres per second. It does not need human help. People can use this technology to build machines and to help in harsh environments like space. The “origami robot” is pretty cheap to make, too. You can make the robots from easy-to-find materials which cost less than $100.	Scientists in the US have created a robot that can build itself. In just four minutes, the “origami robot” can fold itself up and crawl away like a crab. Researchers at Harvard University designed the self- assembling , walking robot from batteries, a motor and materials that fold and bend when heated. When heat is applied, the robot can build itself in under five minutes and walk away at 5cm per second. This groundbreaking technology means this is the first complex, strong robot that can self-assemble without human intervention . “Now that we’ve demonstrated self-building can be used to build functional machines, we think this could be applied to a variety of different problems.” “ Deployment in harsher , exotic environments like space or battlefields, you know, deployable structures that we can put in difficult to reach places.” The sophisticated machines, which are pretty much real-life transformers, operates on a timer, waiting about ten seconds after the batteries are installed to begin folding. And not only that, but they are pretty cheap to make, too. The robots are made with easy-to-find materials that cost less than $100.

It remains unclear how exactly the phone went missing; however, the suspect apparently took the phone while the owner was sleeping and he attempted to eat the device. According to the student, unlike some parts of the world where monkeys live in or near urban areas, there is no history of monkeys stealing things from houses in the local neighbourhood. The man suspects that the monkey may have entered the house through his brother´s open bedroom window.

A popular theme park is in Hong Kong. Many people visit the park every year. But 2020 is a different year. The park must close for many months. The reason is the coronavirus. The park opens again in September. But not as many people can visit it as before. Another problem is tourism. People cannot travel to Hong Kong. It means that tourists do not visit the park. The owners must find ways to make the park interesting for local people. They start yoga classes in an aquarium. People can enjoy camping in the park, too. Many trees and green areas are in the park. It is a big advantage . The owners believe that they can attract more people in the future.	In 2020, a theme park in Hong Kong had to close because of the coronavirus. For the year, the park was closed for more than 200 days. It is open now again, but the park owners must limit the number of visitors by 25%. The chairman of the park said that the current situation was a chance for the park to find new ways to attract visitors. The park is located on the coast and there is a lot of greenery , which makes it possible to do activities like glamping, which is a form of camping, but it is more comfortable. Visitors can also do yoga in an aquarium. Tourists cannot travel to Hong Kong now, so it is necessary to make the park more attractive for local people. The chairman said that it could take years to return to the situation before the coronavirus started.	The coronavirus pandemic has impacted all industries including theme parks. In 2020, Hong Kong´s Ocean Park was forced to close temporarily for over 200 days, and it reopened in September only with limited capacity. Due to travel restrictions, the park totally relies on local visitors; therefore, the owners had to find alternate activities for them. People normally associate ocean parks with pandas and roller coasters rather than hiking, yoga, and glamping ; however, according to the chairman of the Ocean Park, the current situation is an opportunity for the park to reinvent itself. The park has made a loss for the past four consecutive years and there is no inbound tourism in Hong Kong right now; therefore, it is necessary to repurpose the park for a new market. The park wants to maximize and utilize its natural geography and features to come up with something different.

However, animal rights groups argue that the tradition belongs in the history books, claiming that only 17% of islanders eat dolphin meat regularly. Campaigners also claim that many hunters are in violation of Faroe Island´s laws. Even defenders of the tradition expressed disgust at Sunday´s events, with one supporter of the hunt saying that he was appalled by the cruelty. Spectators watched from the shore as the animals were herded into shallow waters. Over a thousand died for their meat and blubber, turning the shallow water red. Supporters fear for the future as arguments between rights groups increase.

This news is about beer. A brewery in Jerusalem brews a very special beer. This beer is 2,000 years old. It is a beer from Jesus’ time. However, the beer is not very good.

It’s after a brewery in Jerusalem produced a craft beer they believe tastes like the beer that was around during Jesus’ time. A team of geneticists at Tel Aviv University identified the strain of wheat used for beer in the Holy Land 2 millennia ago. But a sip of the concoction may explain why wine is the beverage of choice in the Bible. “The flavour was surprising, this is something that we, that we never expected. We got like this kind of red fruit, kind of a raspberry flavour, and there is no fruit additions into it, and it’s only because of the grains we used.” At the time Jesus was around, water was often contaminated so it was safer to drink alcohol. Much of this was fermented but with much lower alcohol percentages than traditionally consumed now. But, if you were hoping to try this ancient-tasting beverage, you’re out of luck. Staff at the brewery have drunk all 20 litres they produced, and aren’t planning on brewing any more.

Scientists study Saturn’s moon. Its name is Mimas. It is 400 miles in diameter . The experts say that the moon is special. Something is not normal there. There are two reasons for this. The moon’s core is either like a rugby ball, or it has an ocean inside.	Scientists have some new information about Saturn’s icy moon Mimas. The moon is 400 miles in diameter . The experts studied it and came to the conclusion that something “isn’t right”. There are actually two possibilities for this. Either the moon’s core is shaped like a rugby ball, or it contains a liquid water ocean.	A new study focusing on the inside of Saturn’s icy moon Mimas suggests that its cratered surfaces hide one of two intriguing possibilities: either the moon’s frozen core is shaped a bit like a rugby ball, or it contains a liquid water ocean . Researchers used a number of images of Mimas taken by NASA’s Cassini Mission to determine how much the moon wobbles , as it orbits Saturn. They later came to the conclusion that the data suggests that something “isn’t right”. An underground ocean is one of two explanations for why the 400-mile diameter moon wobbles. The other possibility is that Mimas has an oblong or rugby ball-shaped core. Whilst scientists believe the ocean idea sounds quite unlikely, a closer look at the moon’s eccentric orbit suggests gravitational tugging by Saturn as the moon circles closer and then further away could cause enough frictional heating to melt ice and form an ocean.

The Constitutional Court of Korea looked into the law, and it says that it is against the constitution that abortions are illegal. The court says that a pregnant woman must have the right to choose. The Korean parliament now must change the law by the end of 2020.	After 66 years of being in place, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that South Korea’s anti-abortion law was unconstitutional. It said that the law is ‘an unconstitutional restriction that violates a pregnant woman’s right to choose’. The court reviewed the law after a doctor challenged the ban, as he had been convicted of performing nearly 70 abortions from 2013 to 2015. Exceptions to the law have only been in life- threatening pregnancies, rape or incest. Doctors who perform abortions can face prison for up to two years, and the women get a fine of more than $1,700 and a year in prison, too. The ruling is making way for South Korea to make abortions legal, although the parliament now has until the end of 2020 to revise the law.

One man pays 300,000 dollars. His son goes to a university in California as a basketball player. The other man pays 220,000 dollars. His son goes to the same university as a water polo player. Four years later, he pays one million dollars to two universities. He wants to know that his daughters can go there. A court says that both men are guilty . They break rules. They pay bribes .

Last week, a court in Boston, USA, said that two rich fathers paid money to get their children into elite US universities. Their children attended as athletic recruits , but the children were not real athletes. In 2018, one man paid 300,000 dollars to get his daughter into a university in California as a basketball recruit.

The verdict was very important for students who worked hard to get into universities and their parents. The verdict showed that even rich and powerful people can not do anything that they want.	A federal jury in Boston convicted two wealthy fathers in the first US college admissions scandal trial. The charges were for corruptly trying to buy their children´s way into elite universities as fake athletic recruits. The jury found a former casino businessman and a finance businessman guilty of using fraud and bribery. The two men are among 57 people charged in which wealthy parents worked with an admissions consultant to get places for their children. One of the fathers supposedly paid 300,000 dollars in 2018 to get his daughter into the University of Southern California as a basketball recruit, while the other man offered 220,000 dollars in 2014 for his son to go to the same university as a water polo recruit. Four years later, he paid one million dollars to try to get his twin daughters into two other universities. Acting US attorney Nathaniel Mendel said that what the men did was an affront to hardworking students and parents. The verdict proved that even these defendants , powerful and privileged people, weren´t above the law.

Subway is a US restaurant chain that sells mainly sandwiches and salads. Last week, a court in Ireland decided that there was too much sugar in Subway´s bread. In Ireland, bread belongs to food with 0% tax . However, according to Irish law, bread must have less than 2% of sugar of the weight of flour in it. In Subway´s bread is 10% of sugar, which means that it is legally not bread, and it belongs to the same group of products as cookies. Subway´s 6-inch white bread has as much sugar as an Oreo cookie. In 2018, Subway closed more than 1,000 restaurants in the US. Some customers started to ask for healthier food; however, Subway was not able to react to the demand .	Ireland´s top court ruled that Subway´s bread was too sugary to meet the definition of ´bread´. The judgment was a response to a Subway´s franchisee who had appealed for a tax refund, arguing that its bread was a staple food and therefore a subject to a 0% tax rate. However, the sugar and fat levels of the food must fall below certain limits; otherwise, it is classified the same as other baked goods like cookies. Surprisingly, Subway´s 6-inch white bread has five grams of sugar, which is similar to an Oreo cookie. The bread has a sugar content of 10% of the weight of the flour included in one dough . However, according to Ireland´s law, the sugar content should not exceed 2% of the weight of flour in the dough. In 2018, the chain closed more than 1,000 locations in the US after struggling to adapt to more health-conscious customers.

These include tanks, of one of the units involved in the maneuvers.
An elephant is  born at Berlin Zoo. The baby is a girl. She is 100 kilograms heavy. That is not much for a baby elephant. It is because she is born early. She does not have a name yet.

She is one of the zoo’s seven Asian elephants. There are six African elephants at the zoo, too. Asian elephants are endangered because people kill them for their tusks and destroy the places where they live.	A Happy New Year means a happy new baby elephant for Berlin’s Tierpark Zoo. The sanctuary has presented its latest addition , a baby elephant who joined the herd on New Year’s Eve. Mum Kewa gave birth to her sixth calf without the help of veterinarians or keepers. Zoo workers said the birth was much earlier than expected but that everything went well. And actually in  hindsight , the early birth was a good thing, meaning the mother could do it all by herself and even went as far as to say, “we as veterinarians, as keepers, have to realise that sometimes we are not that important.” The baby elephant is a girl. The little Asian elephant weighs approximately 100 kilograms, which is rather on the light side for an elephant, which may be due to her early birth. With the birth of the as-yet-unnamed baby, the herd at Tierpark now features six African and seven Asian elephants, after her father, 32-year-old Ankhor, was given away to Prague Zoo in August 2014. Asian Elephants are endangered , the major threat being loss of habitat and poaching for their ivory  tusks .
A heatwave hits the western part of North America. Hot air goes from California, US, to the Arctic. It moves very slowly. Temperatures are almost 50 degrees Celsius in Canada´s British Columbia.

Linton, a town in central British Columbia, Canada, broke Canada´s all-time hottest temperature record three times last week, eventually climbing to 49.4 degrees Celsius. The heat over western parts of Canada and the US has been caused by a dome of static high-pressure hot air stretching from California, US, to the Arctic territories. Climatologists describe the heatwave as spectacular and unprecedented, and they expect it to continue passing high temperature marks set decades ago. At least 233 people died in British Columbia in the last four days, and that´s about 100 more deaths than the average four-day period. Across Canada, people are trying to stay safe and beat  the  heat , seeking shade, water and air conditioners. The extreme heat closed schools, driven up natural gas prices and burned crops across the prairies where farmers grow much of the world´s wheat and canola . Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, to link any single event to global warming is complicated.

I think that the male or female, or both, died out at sea and all of the group drifted ashore at the same time.” It’s the first time in thirty years that this number of whales has beached in the French region. Autopsies will be carried out at the University of Liege to determine the cause of death.

China creates a laser cannon. This laser shoots at drones. It locates them in 5 seconds. People test the system. It destroys 30 out of 30 drones. It is better than helicopters. Why is China afraid of drones? Drones are small and cheap. They are the perfect weapon for terrorists. China wants to have the lasers at big events.	China developed a laser cannon which shoots down small drones. The laser locates the drone in five seconds and then takes it down. People already tested the system, and it shot down 30 out of 30 drones. So, why does China want to protect itself from drones? They are small and cheap – they are the perfect weapon for terrorists and spies. China plans to secure urban events with the new system. China also wants to develop a larger laser. This one will be more powerful, and it will have a greater range , as well.	China claims to have developed a laser cannon that can shoot down small, low-flying drones. The country’s state-controlled news agency said the weapon can hit targets within a radius of 1.2 miles and was designed by the Government Defence Agency to combat possible attacks during major public events in urban areas. But why does China feel the need to protect itself? Well, the kind of miniature drones the laser targets are ones that are now widely available on the consumer market . This is because small, unmanned drones are cheap, quite easy to launch, and in essence are the perfect weapon for terrorists and spies. So how does the laser work? Well, according to a report in the English language China Daily, the laser can hit a drone travelling below 1,600 feet (488 metres) at a speed of up to 110 miles per hour (177 kph), after locating it within five seconds. Developed by the China Academy of Engineering Physics, it claims the laser has a 100 percent success rate, after shooting down more than 30 drones in a recent test, providing better accuracy than snipers and helicopters. They added that the new laser system would be installed or transported in vehicles and is expected to play a key role in securing urban events. According to the state media, the Defence Agency is now developing a larger, more powerful version of its laser with a greater range, allowing the government to increasingly rely on unmanned vehicles.

Some spiders live on the ground. If it rains a lot, these spiders leave. They climb plants. They climb trees. They jump from the trees or the plants. Their web silk comes out. They fly with it. We call this ballooning. This happens a lot. Only some spiders do this at one time. However, thousands of spiders ballooned from somewhere. They rained on a town. This was in Australia. They covered everything with their webs. The webs looked like mounds . It looked scary.	When it rains a lot, there are some types of spiders that balloon to get away from the water. The spider jumps off a tall tree or plant and flies by using its web silk to float through the air. This is a normal event. What happened in Australia was not a normal event because thousands of baby spiders ballooned into a town all at one time. The skies rained down the spiders and their webs now cover gardens and homes in mounds . There were so many webs, the town looked like something from a horror movie.	Residents in New South Wales, Australia had a horrifying shock when thousands of baby spiders quite literally rained down from the sky. Creepy-crawlies invade the town; people found homes and gardens covered with the spiders and mounds of their silky threads. The terrifying scenes would probably cause mass panic in most places, however the phenomenon commonly known as ‘Spider Rain’, ‘Angel Hair’ and ‘ballooning’, is not uncommon across parts of Australia. Ballooning is a form of spider transportation which is when some species of spiders climb to the highest heights that they possibly can, like on the tops of plants or trees. They then use their web as parachutes and leap off. The silk catches on the breeze and carries the spider. People are then left with the gossamer , which is the name for the silver sheets of silken webs left behind. Reportedly, this is going on around us all the time, but at a much smaller scale. The spiders can often travel a pretty big distance and people have seen some come flying more than 2.9 kilometres above the ground. Spiders are thought to come raining down because of a preceding change in a weather conditions. If it rains a lot and the ground gets waterlogged , spiders move their way upwards to avoid drowning.

The Apple Watch goes on sale. People buy it. Some of these people have tattoos. They find out that the watch cannot work with tattoos. It cannot function well. The watch has sensors . The sensors cannot function with tattoos. The watch cannot open or close. It cannot tell things about your body. The Apple website says that the watch has this issue . But it does not say that there are so many problems.	The Apple Watch went on sale last week, and people who have tattoos are finding out that their Apple Watch does not work well with tattoos. They went on social media to let other people know. On the underside of the watch are sensors , and tattoos can confuse them. The watch will not correctly lock, read your heartrate, or read your blood flow. An Apple website says that the tattoos will interfere with the readings but it does not say that it will interfere with other functions.	Early adopters of the Apple Watch who are also bearers of tattoos are complaining that a number of its key functions are disrupted by their ink . Tattooed owners of the new gadget have found that their inked skin confuses the sensors on the underside of the device. Users of the watch, which went on sale last week, took to social media on Thursday under the hashtag “ tattoogate ,” voicing their frustration with the flaw . One anonymous user on website Reddit said the device’s locking mechanism which should disengage when the watch detects it’s being worn, failed to work on tattooed skin. The user wrote, “My hand isn’t tattooed and the watch stayed unlocked. Once I put it back on the area that is tattooed with black ink, the watch would automatically lock again.” An Apple support article says the watch uses green LED lights paired with light-sensitive photo diodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through the wrist and calculate the frequency of heart beats. A website support page from the company also says that tattoos can interfere with readings from the heartrate monitor but does not mention interference with other functions.
Stonehenge is a very special place in southwest England. People build Stonehenge more than 5,000 years ago. They make a big stone circle in a field. The stones are very big and heavy. Scientists do not know exactly how people build Stonehenge. A busy road goes very near Stonehenge. There are many cars. There are often traffic jams . Officials make a project . They want to build a tunnel under Stonehenge. The British government approves the project. The tunnel will be about 3 kilometers long. It will be 50 meters farther than the road. It will cost $2 billion. Some people do not agree with the tunnel. They are afraid that it will hurt Stonehenge.	The British government approved a $2 billion tunnel under Stonehenge. Stonehenge is a prehistoric stone monument in southwest England that people built more than 5,000 years ago. Since 1986, Stonehenge has been on the list of world heritage sites . The reason why officials decided to build a tunnel under Stonehenge was to deal with traffic in the area. There is a very busy road near Stonehenge which becomes narrow, and it often stops traffic. The tunnel will be about three kilometers long, and it will be about 50 metres farther away than the road. Many people protest against the tunnel. They are afraid that it will destroy the stones and the landscape around them.	The British government has given the green light to a controversial $2 billion tunnel under the ancient site of Stonehenge. The project is designed to work on traffic bottlenecks on a major route to southwest England, and it will allow the route to be turned into a divided highway tunnel under the ancient site. A thirteen-kilometer stretch of dual-carriageway will be built, including the three-kilometer tunnel under the world heritage site , about 50 metres further away from the stones than the existing route. However, objectors claim that moving the road underground would not enhance the site and harm the cultural heritage, landscape, and visual impact of Stonehenge. Some people welcome the project and they say that it will reunite Stonehenge with the surrounding prehistoric landscape,
A ship travels from Spain to Turkey. 855 cows are on board. A problem happens with the documents . Spanish officials make a mistake. It seems that the cows are sick.

In December, a Spanish ship took 855 cows on board at the Spanish port of Cartagena. The ship traveled to Turkey but it did not get there. The reason was a mistake in documents and Turkey rejected the animals. Turkey thought that the cattle had bluetongue virus . Other countries rejected the animals, too, so the ship stayed at sea for two months. The journey was too long for the animals, they started to have many health problems, and then some of them died. Spanish veterinarians checked the animals and they saw the bad situation on the ship. They decided that it would be better to kill the animals and end their pain.	More than 854 cattle have spent two months adrift in the Mediterranean after being rejected by several countries. The reason why the animals were stranded at sea were fears that they had bovine bluetongue virus. The vessel is owned and managed by two Lebanese companies while the cattle are owned by a third party. The ship took the male calves, who were about seven to eight months old, on board at the Spanish port of Cartagena in mid-December, and the ship sailed for Turkey. However, a mistake on the Spanish government´s animal health paperwork led Turkey to reject the cattle, fearing that they could be infected with bluetongue. According to a report by Spanish government veterinarians, the animals were no longer fit for transport and they should be killed. The animals have been kept in very poor conditions and they have suffered from the lengthy journey. The report concluded that euthanasia would be the best solution for the animals´ health and welfare.

In 1997, Britain handed the territory back under a special agreement with China known as ‘one country, two system’. Hong Kong’s autonomy is supposed to last until 2047, but China has signalled that it might not be willing to wait that long.
A man plan to swim around Britain. His name is Ross Edgley. The swim is around 2,700 kilometres long. It will take him 100 days. During the swim, he cannot touch the ground.

J.K. Rowling is the author of the “Harry Potter” books. She writes “Harry Potter” while sitting on a chair. She leaves a message on the chair. It says, “I wrote ‘Harry Potter’ while sitting on the chair.” This chair goes up for auction. You can buy it for 65,000 dollars. It is a lot of money. Valuers say that it is worth it .

Rowling wrote the “Harry Potter” series is going up for auction, and it comes with a letter from the author. The chair and the letter will cost you 65,000 dollars. Valuers , however, say that the high price is worth every penny because of the importance in a “Harry Potter” history. There are not many things in the “Harry Potter” world that are so valuable because the books became very popular very fast. Publishers published them in large editions, so they are very common.

Rowling used when she wrote the “Harry Potter” series. The place that inspired “Harry Potter” and created millions of so-called Potterheads is hitting the auction block – and with a hefty price tag. Once owned by J.K. Rowling, it comes with a letter from the author explaining how sad she was to let it go. And valuers say the steep bidding price for the two together is worth every penny because of their importance in “Harry Potter” history. “Well, as a chair it’s probably not very exciting and, in fact, she said at that time that it was something you’d pick up in a junk  shop for a tenner , but it’s really just a fact that she took the time to decorate it, and the fact that she actually wrote the books in it is important. But the fact that she took the time to decorate it and sign it and say, ‘I wrote ‘Harry Potter’ in this chair’, I think, is very important. There’s not that many things in the ‘Harry Potter’ world that are especially valuable because her books became so popular so fast, and then they were published in huge editions so they’re not that uncommon.” And just in case it wasn’t clear enough, the sides of the chair are inscribed by the author herself with, “I wrote Harry Potter while sitting on this chair.” The live auction will be held at New York City’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel and online for all the Potterheads out there who want to get their hands and their backsides on this significant seat.

This case is about the future. What is at  stake here is: Can the government compel Apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world, including the US.” The Apple chief defended the company’s refusal to comply with the FBI’s order to remove security blocks on the attackers’ device, comparing the change on software to a disease. “The only way know would be to write a piece of software that we view as a sort of a software equivalent of cancer. We think it is a bad news to write. We would never write it, we have never written it. And that’s what is the stake here. If we knew a way to get the information on the phone, that we haven’t already given, if we knew a way to do this, that would not expose hundreds of millions for other people’s issues , we would obviously do it.” Conflicting polls suggest the American public’s divided, but Cook is remaining firm on his position. “We need to stand tall, and stand tall on principle .”

The revolutionary plane which can fly day and night without fuel is as light as a car and is the product of 12 years of research. “This is the first aeroplane ever which has an unlimited endurance , can fly day and night, can fly a week, can fly months. And for this it uses the sun and only the sun in fact to propel the aeroplane. That’s the only source of energy, collecting everyday enough to fly through the day, enough to store it, to fly through the night and be able to continue the following day.” Running on solar energy to power its 17,000 solar cells, if tests are successful, the plane is set to make it round the world in five consecutive days and nights in March 2015.

Cassius Clay is an African-American man. He is a boxer. He is 22 years old. He wins an important match . It makes him the heavyweight champion of the world. At this time, he changes his name to Muhammed Ali. He fights for many things. He lives in America during segregation . He fights for equality for African Americans. He also fights against war. Over many years, Muhammed Ali wins many boxing matches. He is very famous. Sadly, his boxing matches injure his head. He starts helping people instead. Muhammed Ali dies recently. He is 74 years old. People remember him.	At the age of 22, an African American man named Cassius Clay became the heavyweight champion of the world after he won an important boxing match. He then converted to the religion of Islam and changed his name to Muhammed Ali. He became very famous for winning his boxing matches and for his politics. When America was at war in Vietnam, he refused to be part of it due to his religion. When America had segregation , he fought for equality of African Americans. Repeated head trauma made Muhammed Ali sick, so he helped people later in life. He died at age 74.	“I am the greatest!” He said it first but it wasn’t long before many agreed — Muhammad Ali, world champion boxer, often political activist , and eternal icon. “This will be no contest. This will be a total annihilation !” He was born Cassius Marcellus Clay and grew up in the Deep South during a time of segregation between the races. It was difficult to keep Ali quiet. His fight for equality was one of his many memorable battles. But perhaps most of all, Ali became known for his fast fists, swift step and wicked wit. “I’m going to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. George can’t hit what a guy can’t see.” Just 22 years old, Ali took up his mantle as the new heavyweight champion of the world after a stunning upset over Sonny Liston. He changed his name and joined the Nation of Islam, later converting to the Sunni sect of the faith. “In Islamic religion we have a saying ‘Allahu Akbar’. ‘Allahu Akbar’ means ‘God is the greatest’. So I’m not God, I’m just the greatest in the sport of boxing.” Ali defended his title nine times before being banned for refusing – on religious grounds – to serve in Vietnam. “Why should we and other so-called Negros go 10,000 miles away from home here in America to drop bombs and bullets on other innocent brown people who’ve never bothered us?” After three years of legal challenges during his prime boxing years, he won a high court appeal and made his return to the ring. “They might put my tail in jail and get me out on bail after what I do to Joe Frazier. I’m going to do something to Joe Frazier. This will be such a good whooping , such a dynamic beating, such a superior whooping!” But it wasn’t to be. Joe Frazier won the so-called Fight of the Century on points in the 15th round – Ali’s first-ever professional defeat. Then came the ‘Rumble in the Jungle’ in Central Africa. Unveiling his new tactic, the ‘rope-a-dope.’ Ali wore down his opponent George Foreman and was once again world champion, at the age of 32. “I injure a stone and I hospitalise a brick. I’m so bad I made medicine sick.” But along with the victories came a heavy price. In the early 1980s, Ali developed noticeable tremors and slurs in his speech. Four years later came his Parkinson’s diagnosis – a disease linked with head trauma . Over time, he began to devote himself to charitable causes, sometimes up to 200 days a year. “All my life growing up as a little boy, I always said if I could get famous, I would do things to help my people that other people won’t do.” For a man, who has often dominated the world of sport, politics and celebrity, it’s fair to say there was and will always be something magical about Muhammad Ali.
In Hong Kong, there is an art exhibit . You can see photographs at the exhibit. The photographs show Donald Trump. The pictures are unusual. A person is in one photograph. The person wears a blonde hairpiece . You cannot see the face. Pieces of a pig cover the face. There are sheep’s eyes, too. There are other things in the photographs. These are symbols for Donald Trump. They show how the artist sees Trump.	People portray Donald Trump in many ways, but a British artist used pig and sheep parts to represent him. In Hong Kong, you can see the Trump installation . The installation shows photographs of a human model who wears a blond hairpiece over a face made of pig’s snout and sheep’s eyeballs. There are more things in the photographs, and all of them have symbolic meanings. The artist used the installation to show how he sees Trump.	Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been portrayed in many ways during his time in the spotlight , many focusing on his bouffant hair, orange skin and supposedly small hands. But a British artist has now used raw pig and sheep’s parts to represent him in a whole new way at a Hong Kong art show. “Well, I mean, so if you look at the elements in the work, it’s full of references to the commodities market, whether that’s crude oil pouring out of the holes of his suit, which are chunks of rubble that I’ve painted gold in reference to his empire of buildings, and, you know, essentially although it seems clear that financially he would’ve been better off just investing all of his inheritance , most of which he’s been involved in his failed business  ventures whilst at the same time promising that he’s gonna make America great.” The Trump installation is a photograph of a human model wearing a blond bouffant hairpiece over a face constructed from a real pig’s snout and sheep’s eyeballs. But that’s not all: a half-eaten croissant, raw fish, chunks of rubble covered in gold leaf and a suit splashed with crude oil complete the ensemble . He went on to say that he has used this installation to illustrate his impressions of Trump, stating that he is nothing more than a “ deranged , insecure  attention-seeker “.

Facebook stops Donald Trump’s account. The account is his way to go on Facebook. The ban is two years long. The ban comes because Trump breaks Facebook’s rules. Trump says that it isn’t OK when Facebook stops people. Facebook says that Trump’s account can be open again if Trumps behaves  well on social media. If the ban is finished after two years, Trump can use Facebook for the next presidential election in 2024.	Facebook stopped Donald Trump’s account for two years because he broke Facebook’s rules. Trump said that the decision was an insult to those who voted for him in 2020. Trump also said that Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to do such things. Facebook said that Trump’s account will reopen if Trumps behaves well on social media. The two-year ban means that Trump will be able to use his Facebook and Instagram accounts before the next presidential election in 2024.	Facebook suspended Donald Trump from its platform for two years because he violated Facebook’s rules. Soon after the announcement, Trump said that the decision was an insult to those who voted for him in the 2020 election. Trump also said that Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing. Facebook said that Trump’s account will only be reinstated if the risk to public safety has receded . The timing of Trump’s two-year suspension means he won’t be able to use his Facebook and Instagram accounts ahead of the 2022 elections when Republicans will be competing for seats in Congress, but he may be able to return to those platforms well before the next presidential election in 2024.
Four libraries in Australia have robots. The robots teach kids. They teach coding , critical thinking , and how to solve problems. Kids can tell the robots to walk, dance, or do other things. Technology is growing very fast. These children start to learn coding early. This is good for them. They can have good jobs in the future.	A project gave four Australian libraries robots. The robots teach kids coding, critical thinking skills, and how to solve problems. The children can get excited with coding by telling the robots to walk, dance, or follow other instructions. The technology industry is always growing. These kids start to learn coding early, which will be very useful. Some of them may even get into high-tech jobs in the future.	The Brain Initiative project gave robots to four libraries across Australia. One woman at one of the libraries said that the robots are teaching the kids a skill set, critical thinking skills, and how to problem solve. Ray the Robot is one of those robots, and it can walk, dance, follow instructions, and get kids excited about coding with computers. With the technology industry constantly growing, kids are at an advantage if they learn the basics at a young age, which could then even land some of them into high-tech jobs in the future.

A meteorite is a piece of rock. It falls from the sky. It can weigh a few grams. The biggest meteorites weigh almost 60 tons. Meteorites come from an asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid belt is a place with many asteroids in space. Asteroids go around the sun. Many meteorites fall in Morocco. People look for them. These people are meteorite hunters. They walk through the dunes . They write about a meteorite when they find it. They take a picture of it. Many meteorites are in museums around the world. Scientists in Morocco start a university in 2016. They study meteorites there. Meteorites are very important for them.	A meteorite is a piece of rock which falls from the sky, and it can weigh from a few grams to more than 60 tons. Scientists think that meteorites come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Morocco is a country where many meteorites fall, and people called meteorite hunters search large areas to find them. Sometimes they spend months walking through the dunes until they find something. When they find a meteorite, they write all the details about it into a technical card. They write exactly where they found it, and they take a picture of the place. Meteorites are very important for scientists, but many meteorites end up in museums around the world. In 2016, Abderrahmane Ibhi created a university in Adagir, Morocco, where scientists study meteorites. They want meteorites to stay in Morocco because meteorites are an important part of the country´s geology .	A meteorite is a fragment of rock or iron from outer space that survives the trip through the atmosphere to reach the surface of the earth. Meteorites are believed to originate in the asteroid belt between the planets of Mars and Jupiter. A meteorite may be in size from less than a gram to more than 60 tons. Meteorites, prevalent in Morocco, help expand scientific research, and meteorite hunters like Ali Lamghari spend months roaming the sand dunes searching for them. Sometimes they find a meteorite and sometimes they don´t. When they do, they complete a technical card for it, record the GPS coordinates of the place, and they take a picture of the exact spot where the sample was found. More than 50% of the meteorites that are in international museums or laboratories were found in Morocco, and they give great scientific information. On this basis, the University Museum of Meteorites was established in Adagir, Morocco, in 2016. Its aim is to preserve meteorite samples and to limit Morocco´s loss of its geological history that is sold to foreigners and international museums.
There is a centre in Saint Petersburg. It helps baby seals. The baby seals are hurt . One seal goes to the centre. Somebody brings it. The seal is very young. It is covered in oil.

It was covered in oil when it was brought to the centre. There was a great danger that it would die, but the seal survived. The seal is very attached to people. That is a big problem because the animals are returned into the wild . Most of the animals are brought to the centre by locals .	A rehabilitation centre in Saint Petersburg has been rescuing these baby seals, suffering from climate change and pollution . Staff members at the centre have been fighting for the life of this little one in particular, after the newborn was brought to the centre covered in oil. “There was a high probability that he would die from oil intoxication but he survived. Plus,when he got here he was either newborn or two or three days old. He’s emotionally very attached to people, which creates a big problem for us. We will have to work with him to detach him from people.” Most of the animals get to the centre thanks to local residents walking along the shore, who often find them weak or wounded . Staff has been working on rehabilitating the seals since 2007 and have rescued and released more than 20 into the wild since then.

She tried to breathe slowly, but it did not help. Later, she visited a different hospital and the doctors helped her there.	“April 2nd at 6:42 and the sensation is happening again.” Quick-thinking Stacey Yepes from Canada filmed this video of herself whilst suffering symptoms of a stroke . “It’s all tingly on left side…  on the left side.” After doctors insisted she was suffering from stress and sent her away, Stacey recognised her partial face paralysis and numbness in her arm return as she was driving, so she pulled over and grabbed her phone. “It happened this morning again.” Stacey tries to lift her arm with difficulty and says she finds it hard to point at specific things like her nose. “So, now I’m taking a picture for an example of what happens. My hand is hard to lift up. And to touch something, touch my nose.” She also films herself following the advice of the doctors to simply breathe slowly in and out to manage stress, but the symptoms persist. “The doctor said to breathe in, breathe out, manage your stress. And I’m trying. I don’t know why this is happening to me.” After filming herself, Stacey visited a different hospital from her first visit and was told by doctors she was having a mini stroke. Further tests confirmed that she had a small blockage in one of the arteries supplying her brain.

Purin has certainly proved that she is much more than just a pretty face.
Scientists study orangutans. They study their sounds. They look at their genes . They discover a new type of orangutan. They call it the Tapanuli orangutan. It lives in Sumatra. There are only 800 Tapanuli orangutans in the wild. They are in danger of dying out.	Scientists found a new kind of orangutan in Sumatra. This is the first discovery of a new great ape in almost 100 years. It is the Tapanuli orangutan. The experts identified the new species by looking at the genes. They also listened to the sound of the animals. There are only 800 of these orangutans in the wild. They are in danger of extinction .	Scientists announced that they discovered a new species of orangutan in Sumatra, describing a new great ape in almost a century. The experts identified the species by examining the sounds that it makes and looking at its genes. There are only 800 specimens of the Tapanuli orangutan left in the wild, and the primates are in danger of going extinct because their habitat in Sumatra is under  threat .
An office in Sweden does something very different. It implants microchips in its workers. One worker thinks that this is scary and exciting . The workers use the microchips to do things. The microchips open doors. They share contact information about people. They run the copy machine. The boss at the office likes the microchips. He says that they can do even more things. They can send information to doctors. Only you choose where to send the information from your microchip.	An office in Sweden is doing something unusual by implanting microchips in its workers. With the microchips, the workers can open doors, share contact information and use the copy machine. One worker said that it was scary but exciting. The workers get the microchips only if they want to get them. The boss of the office said that the microchips also could be used for making payments or sending information to your doctor. He said that only you grant access to the people and the places you send information with the microchip.	An office in Sweden is taking wearable technology to the next level by implanting  microchips into its staff. Yes, that’s right; the newly opened Epicenter office complex in Stockholm is offering workers the chance to be chipped under the skin of their hands. The radio frequency identification chip, which is about the size of a grain of rice, allows users to open doors, swap contact details, and use the photocopier. “It felt pretty scary but at the same time it felt very modern, very 2015!” The chipping is entirely voluntary and according to manufacturers , it’s completely safe. “So some of the future areas of use, I think, like anything where you today would use a pin code or a key or card. So payments is I think is one area. I think also for healthcare reasons that you can sort of communicate with your doctor and you can get data on what you eat and sort of what your physical state is. You have your own identification code and you’re sending that to something else which you have to grant access to. So there’s no one else that can follow you on your ID , so to say. It’s you who decides who gets access to that ID.”
The Vatican writes a document. It is 31 pages long. It talks about ‘gender theory’. It tells Catholic schools, parents and others how to talk about ‘gender theory’. The document criticises ‘radical’ forms of gender identity. It says that gender identity is only about what people feel and what they want. It says that there is some confusion . The document says that being transgender or gender neutral is not real. Some LGBTQ groups react to the document. They do not like it. However, the document also talks about respect. The Vatican thinks that everyone must be respected. People can be who they want to be. It is important to respect them. It is not OK to attack people. It is not OK to say terrible things to them.	The Vatican released a 31-page paper that explains in detail how Catholic schools, parents and others should talk about ‘gender theory’. The document criticises ‘radical’ forms of gender identity. It says that gender identity is based on only feeling, wants and confusion . The paper goes on to say that the idea of being transgender or gender neutral is not real. Some LGBTQ groups were quick to criticise the Vatican because they see things differently. Also, some people are thinking about why the document was released in June because people wrote it in February 2019. The month of June is the Pride Month. People choose to remember the Stonewall rebellion, which took place at the end of June 1969. The rebellion was a demonstration against police attacks on people in a gay bar in New York. However, the document says that everyone should be respected. The Vatican is against attacking people or saying terrible things to them only because they are ‘different’.	The Vatican released a 31-page paper which explains in detail how Catholic schools, parents and others should talk about ‘gender theory’. The document says that ‘radical’ forms of gender identity are based on ‘nothing more than a confused concept of freedom in the [area] of feelings and wants’. The paper goes on to say that the idea of being transgender or gender neutral is not real. Some LGBTQ groups were quick to criticise the Vatican, as they see the matter differently. People wrote the document in February 2019 but they released it now in June, which is Pride Month. Such timing also raised some questions. People chose june to be the LGBT Pride Month to remember the Stonewall rebellion, which took place at the end of June 1969. The rebellion was a demonstration against police attacks on people in a gay bar in New York. It is important to say, though, that the document also calls for respect for everyone. It says: ’No one should suffer bullying , violence , insults or unjust discrimination based on their specific characteristics.’
Three astronauts return to Earth from the International Space Station. One astronaut is American. Her name is Kate Rubins. She is a microbiologist. A microbiologist studies the smallest living things. For example, these are bacteria or viruses. She studies gravity , too. She wants to know the impact of gravity on our bodies. The other two astronauts who return are Russian. The astronauts spend 185 days in space. They go around Earth almost 3,000 times. They travel back home in a small spaceship. They travel 400 kilometers in the spaceship. They land safely in Kazakhstan. Doctors must check that they are healthy. Afterward, the two Russian astronauts will go to their training place in Russia.

The very big planets are Jupiter or Saturn.	Recently, a NASA satellite found three new planets that are about 73 light-years away. They are interesting because they intermediate and similar in size. In our solar system, there are either small planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars or really big planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Also, the size of the new planets is intermediate, which is something new. When it comes to their size and composition , they are somewhere between Earth and Neptune. Scientists say that the planets can be a missing type of planets.	Last April, a NASA satellite launched and discovered three new planets, which may be ‘missing links’ of planetary formation. All three planets orbit a star about 73 light-years away, which is relatively close by interstellar standards. One of the planets is a large rocky planet, and NASA calls it a super-Earth. The other two are mini-Neptunes and are about half the size of our Neptune. While our own solar system is populated with planetary extremes, from the small, rocky worlds of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars to the much greater Jupiter and Saturn, these new planets appear to be relatively close in size. Also, there is no planet intermediate in size in our system, and yet one of the planets is somewhere in the middle of Earth and Neptune in terms of size and composition .

According to science, no ancient Egyptian magic was moving the statue but rather human activity, such as transportation. The reason that the other artifacts did not move is because of the statue’s convex base. The other statues have flat bottoms.

Calais has changed a lot in the last 15 years – industrial sites closing, migrants who are trying to cross to England. At the moment, they are trying to force through the tunnel. SeaFrance closed, and now MyFerryLink is filing for bankruptcy, so Calais is getting weaker every day and with every coming year.”

Spiders can make a wide range of different silks, and this very thin little silk is used fly away with the breeze. When the animals find a suitable landing spot, they use their tiny parasails to hold onto the tops of the vegetation which they then quickly climb up.

Nike introduces new shoes. These shoes are special. You do not have to tie these shoes. They do it for you. They are self-tying. You just put the shoes on. They do everything else. We do not know the price of these shoes. However, they look like they are from the future. There is a battery in the shoes. It lasts for two weeks.	Nike introduced the very first self-tying shoe. You just take the shoe, put it on, and when your heel is in, the shoe automatically adjusts to a comfortable fit. There are also two more buttons, which let you adjust the fit. Nike didn’t say how much the shoes are going to cost, but these shoes can really take you to the future. Soon, you may not need to get down to tie your shoe laces . There is a battery inside the shoe, which will last for around 2 weeks.	Power laces, al-right! Yes, “Back to the Future” has finally reached the now, meaning reaching down to tie your shoe laces could become a thing of the past with Nike revealing the very first self-tying shoe. “You take the shoe, you just slide it on , when your heel hits the sensor, it’ll automatically close and adjust to a comfortable fit. Then if you want further adjustment, you press the tighten button or you press the loosen button. You go about your day…” Apparently , it will even adapt to your preferred setting, meaning you won’t have to fiddle around with those buttons for long. So the pain of shoe tying is gone, but there’s something else you’ll have to worry about with these shoes—charging them. Yeah, of course, they don’t work without a battery, but Nike says each charge will last around 2 weeks. So Chistino Ronaldo loves the trainers. But what about when his football boots get really muddy? Well, they’ve apparently solved this too, revealing new boots that are made with a polymer that stops mud sticking to the sole . So life on our feet has got very easy, but there’s no word on just how much it’s going to cost. I’m sure many will see it as a small price to pay to feel like they’re back to the future.

Farmers in Sri Lanka are not happy. The government says that they cannot use chemical fertilizers. A fertilizer is a substance which farmers put in the ground. It helps plants grow better. In the past, most farmers use chemical fertilizers. In Sri Lanka, now, they must use organic fertilizers. The government says that it is better for the natural world. Sadly, farmers do not know how to do it. The government does not help them. Thousands of farmers protest . More than 60% of people in Sri Lanka depend on farmers. It is possible that people will not have enough food. They also agree that farmers must use less chemicals.	In May this year, the Sri Lankan government decided that farmers could not use chemical fertilizers . The reason was that the country wanted to be friendlier to the natural world. Sri Lanka wanted to have agriculture that would be 100% organic . It meant that farmers would use no chemicals at all. Then it brought many problems, and thousands of farmers protested. Recently, it was time to start planting rice, but some farmers could not do it, and they waited for the government’s help, which did not come. Almost two thirds of people in Sri Lanka work in or need agriculture, and many farmers believe that people will not have enough food. Officials said that the move towards organic farming would not be easy, but most people agreed that it was important.

Many farmers argue that the move will hurt the industry and harm the country’s food amount. Almost two thirds of Sri Lanka’s population depends on agriculture, and the industry is 7% of the country’s GDP . Early monsoon season usually means the start of planting for rice farmers across the country; however, this year, many are planting less than usual as they wait for the government’s assistance to shift to organic farming. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that the shift has been shaky ; however, various industries of the society support it.

Lufthansa is a German airline. It is one of the largest airlines in the world. Lufthansa gives good news last week. The company wants to make the first CO2 neutral flight. A carbon neutral flight means that the flight has no CO2 impact on the natural world. One way is to use biofuel. Biofuel comes from plants or animal waste . A second way is to plant trees in Africa. It means that the flight is not CO2 neutral. But people plant trees to help the natural world. Some companies have big problems now. The reason is the coronavirus. Some companies need less oil. It means that some refineries will close. It is possible that some companies will use biofuel instead of normal oil. But the problem with biofuel is that it costs three to six times more than normal oil.	Lufthansa is a German company and it is one of the world´s largest airlines. Last week, Lufthansa announced that it would make the first CO2 neutral flight. Lufthansa will use biofuel, which is a fuel that is made from plants or animal waste. The problem is that biofuel is three to six times more expensive that conventional fuel so it is not very likely that airlines will use it very much in the near future. The coronavirus has caused companies to need less oil and it is possible that some refineries will have to close. This could force some companies to start using biofuel and become greener which means that they would use technologies that are less harmful to the environment.	German airline Lufthansa said that it would become the first airline to operate a CO2 neutral cargo flight. According to Lufthansa, it was possible by using so-called sustainable aviation fuel for the flight. Peter Gerber, the chairman of Lufthansa cargo group, says that a flight becomes CO2 neutral if it uses biofuel which already includes CO2. However, Gerber does not expect biofuel to become used more widely anytime soon because it is between three and six times more expensive than conventional kerosene . Global oil demand has been crushed by this year´s events and it may never fully recover. It leads to the closure of refineries and forces some companies to opt for cleaner alternatives that convert plants to produce biofuels.

I joined the army as a teenager, hoping to better myself, and I believe I did that whilst on operations in Afghanistan. One day, whilst on patrol I was asked to blow a hole in a building, not knowing what was on the other side. I thought to myself, what if… what if there’s a baby, what if it’s there with its mother, what if it’s there with a whole family… I would much rather live my life not having to deal with the consequences of ‘what if’. That is why I throw these medals back. What if every soldier past and present did this?” “If you look close enough at these medals, you can see the reflections of dead Iraqis, you can see the embers of Libya and you can see the faces of the men and women of the British Armed Forces who didn’t return and also those who did with lost limbs and shattered souls. I no longer require these medals.” A Downing Street police officer picked up the discarded medals and said they will be well looked after. Ben Griffin, the group’s spokesperson, said it was an emotional moment for the ex-soldiers and that veterans do not throw away their medals lightly.

Hyperloop could be the future of transportation. People test its prototype . They test it in the Nevada desert. The test is successful. It goes from 0 to 187 kilometres per hour in one second. That is very fast. The real Hyperloop can be even faster. It can be as fast as the speed of sound. The journey in California from San Francisco to Los Angeles could take just 30 minutes. Hyperloop will use special tubes . Air will slow down the things that move. There is almost no air in the tubes.	The prototype of Hyperloop completed its first successful test in the Nevada desert. A sled on a special track accelerated to 187 kilometres per hour in just over one second. If Hyperloop becomes a reality, it will be much faster. It will move people through low-pressure tubes at the speed of sound. It could be the future of transport. In California, the journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles will take just 30 minutes. The system will be fully autonomous and electricity will power it.	It may not look like much now, but this could be the future of transport. It’s called Hyperloop and this week it completed its first successful test in the Nevada desert. If the idea becomes a reality, the Hyperloop will whisk people and cargo through low-pressure tubes at the speed of sound. The system will be fully autonomous, powered by electricity, and the pods will levitate, using electro-magnetism to reduce friction . “It’s not about getting somewhere; it’s about being somewhere. We’re not trying to optimise the transportation experience — we’re trying to eliminate it. So we think this is great. I think you guys think this is great. What are we going to do? Let’s build it!” This is just a prototype. The sled seen here accelerated to 116 mph (187 kph) in just over a second. But the real thing will, in theory, be a great deal faster again, completing the journey from San Francisco to LA in just 30 minutes.

People usually do two things with a dead body. One thing is to use cremation. Cremation is when you burn the body. The other thing is to bury the body. This is when you put the body in the ground. Natural Funeral is a US company. This company does different things. They do water cremation and green burial . Both are more friendly to the natural world. They do not make any emissions . They do not take space in the ground. Water cremation changes the body into a fertilizer . Green burial changes the body into compost . Both ways mean that the body returns to nature. The body becomes different. The body helps plants grow.	When someone dies, there are two ways that people usually follow for what to do with the dead body. One way is cremation, which means burning the body. The other way is burying the body in the ground. Neither way is good for the environment. Cremation makes a lot of emissions , and burning in the ground takes up a lot of space. It also puts dangerous substances in the ground. Natural Funeral is a US company which does water cremation and green burial. Water cremation is a process when workers put a dead body into water, and they mix it with some other substances. When the process ends, the body turns into a natural fertilizer . Green burial is similar to composting . Workers put a dead body inside a special container with straw in it. They add some chemicals to help the composting. Both ways are legal in three US states, and the ways help the body return to nature where it came from.	Water cremation and human composting are new alternatives to traditional burials. Both alternatives reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cremation, and they don´t take up land. Seth Vidal from Natural Funeral explains how water cremation works. The company takes a dead person and add waters and an alkali process. When the process is done, the so-called essence is left. The essence has every ingredient for a natural organic fertilizer. Water cremation is a more environmentally friendly option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cremation and to take up land during a burial. The method is legal in three US states, and it allows natural organic processes to happen, which is basically human compost. In human composting, a body is placed inside a container, laid on top of straw, and some ingredients are added that help make the composting. The body composts as it would naturally do inside of the earth, and all the parts that are left in the body go back to nature, and they help create new life.

People say that something must change. Countries must change their industries. It is important to use cleaner energy. Companies must build more modern buildings. Factories must reduce emissions . It is necessary to change the way that people think. They must think of a good future for everyone. People must not harm the natural world.	The coronavirus had a big impact on many countries in the world. It tested countries´ health care systems and it influenced people´s daily lives. It hurt businesses and economies. Many businesses closed down. However, some people believe that it is a good opportunity to change. The International Energy Agency is an organization of 30 countries, and it is based in France. The agency said that the coronavirus crisis was a chance to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy. It is necessary to make more modern buildings and change transportation and electricity network. The most important thing is to reduce emissions and invest a lot of money in technologies that do not destroy the natural world.	As the coronavirus pandemic has filled hospitals, challenged populations, and decimated economies, it may be opening a door for new, sustainable future. The International Energy Agency released a special report on sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 economic meltdown . The organization of 30 nations, that is based in Paris, France, is calling for global investments in clean energy technologies to broaden the recovery from the worst global economic shock since the 1930s. The agency said that the crisis gave governments a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transit from fossil fuels to a cleaner energy future. The goal is to modernize building construction, transportation systems and the electrical grid while cutting down on carbon emissions.

The plane, the Airbus E-Fan, is 6 metres long, 590 kilograms heavy and releases zero emissions . Its batteries let it fly for up to 50 minutes. It has two seats and a total engine power of 60kW.	A row has broken between two pilots who both claim to be the first to fly an electric plane across the English Channel. Pilot Didier Estyene’s Airbus E-Fan plane was airborne for 37 minutes on Friday. He made the 46-mile (74 kilometres) journey from Lydd in Kent to Calais. But Hugues Duval also believes he made aviation history with a similar return journey leaving France on Thursday. The flights are considered symbolically important steps towards making electronic planes viable in the long term. Since there’s no oil or water, the 6-metre-long, 590-kilogram jet releases zero emissions. Airbus’ twin-engine plane is powered by batteries, enabling it to stay airborne for up to 50 minutes. It has two seats and a 31ft wing-span (9.4 metres) with a total engine power of 60kW. Mr Esteyne described the experience as similar to flying a glider because there’s less noise than an aeroplane. While he described the flight as smooth and very quiet, there may well be unrest to come in deciding who claims the title in aviation history.

Fathers in England are getting older. In the 1990s, they were 31. Now, they are 33. Younger fathers have healthier children, so this is a problem. One British doctor has a solution . He suggests that young men freeze their sperm . When the man is old, and he wants to have a baby, he can use his frozen sperm.	The average age of fathers in England and Wales in the early 1990s was 31. Now, it is 33 – fathers are getting older and older. This is not a good thing when it comes to health of the child. The sperm of older men contain larger number of mutations and the child is then more prone to disease. One British doctor suggests that 18 year-old men freeze their sperm. When they’re older and they want to have babies, they can use their frozen sperm. So what do you think? Freezing eggs from women planning families isn’t that unusual, is it?	The average age of fathers in England and in Wales has increased from 31 in the early 90s to 33 today, and with Britain’s obesity -ridden , binge drinking culture, it probably could be argued that men are not doing themselves many favours. An 18-year-old man might not be anywhere near thinking about having children, but Dr. Kevin Smith says that earlier fatherhood should be promoted to young men and the NHS should support them in freezing their sperm. This is to avoid the risk of children suffering genetic disorders, as the sperm of older men apparently contains larger numbers of mutations, meaning that it is more prone  to things like autism and schizophrenia. Men in their 40s or older might prefer to use frozen younger sperm rather than the fresh stuff . It could be argued that sperm freezing not only provides an artificial approach to reproduction, but also a false sense of security – freezing a man’s sperm does not necessarily guarantee men a baby.

They have said from now on, he will be given expert care and the  best possible chance to return one day to his home in the forest.

The Japanese Emperor is over 80 years old. He is the Emperor since 1989. He speaks to the people. He says that he is old. He wishes to abdicate . The Japanese people understand.

In what was only his second-ever televised address , Japan’s Emperor Akihito this morning indicated his wish to hand over his duties. The 82 year-old has been on the throne since his father’s death in 1989, but a series of health problems has cast doubt on the future of his reign, though an abdication would be unprecedented . “As I am now more than 80 years old”, he said, “there are times when I feel various constraints such as in my physical fitness. In the last few years, I’ve started to reflect on my years as the emperor and contemplate my role and my duties as the emperor in the days to come.” He went on to say, “I think it’s not possible to continue perpetually reducing the Emperor’s actions in matters of state and his duties as the symbol of the state.” Finishing, “I sincerely hope for your understanding.” Opinion polls show the vast majority of ordinary Japanese people do sympathise with his wish to retire, but legal changes would be needed to make it possible. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reacted quickly to the address and said the government would carefully consider what it could do.

The Bank of England has unveiled its first plastic banknote – a five-pound note, featuring the face of Sir Winston Churchill. The new fiver is printed on a thin plastic film called polymer, which is said to be more durable and secure. According to Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the notes offer advanced security features. “Polymer marks a major innovation. It’s cleaner, safer and stronger. It’s resistant to dirt and moisture so the note won’t wear out as quickly as the current fibres. It’s stronger than paper and can better withstand being repeatedly folded into wallets or scrunched up into pockets. Polymer notes can survive a splash of claret , a flick of cigar ash, a nip of a bulldog and even the spin afterwards in the washing machine.” The new plastic five-pound note will go into circulation in September with 440 million notes being printed. For the last 300 years, Brits have been content with paper money, but not anymore as the nation follows countries such as Canada and Australia in the plastic one-der revolution. And this is just the beginning. This note will be followed by a new plastic ten-pound note featuring Jane Austen in the summer of 2017, as well as a plastic twenty-pound note featuring J. M. W. Turner by 2020.

This is what the Swiss Alps looked like on February 6. Skies turned a spectacular shade of orange, not only in Switzerland, but across parts of southwestern Europe. Sahara dust blanketed parts of southern and central Europe, and it caused a sharp rise in air pollution across the region. It´s a common yearly phenomenon as sands and dust from the Sahara desert in Africa are swept northwards. However, this year is particularly impressive due to stronger winds and the volume of sand in the air. Skiers at a resort in Anzere, Switzerland, enjoyed the orange snow and the brightly colored skies last weekend. In Lyon, France, people were also mesmerized by the views of the Sahara sand colors taking over the city. The concentration of Sahara dust didn´t reach levels that scientists consider harmful because the particles are too big to enter the lungs and cause breathing difficulties.

Russia will deliver thirty-eight billion cubic metres of natural gas into China starting in 2018. It is a 30-year-old deal worth around 400 billion dollars. The USA has been trying to isolate President Putin. This pact of China and Russia is something the USA is not happy about.

The problem was that there was too much water, and the water is dangerous for the workers. The Japanese government plans to slowly dump the water into the sea. Scientists thought of other possibilities, but this one seems to be the safest. Fishermen in the area are not happy with the government´s plan. They worry that people will stop buying fish from them.	Japanese media said that, starting in 2022, the government was planning to slowly dump more than 1 million tons of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear disaster into the sea. The question of what to do with the wastewater has been a contentious point for some time, and now, the Japanese government is running out of space and time. Some of the water was used to cool the nuclear plant after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The rest is a collection of contaminated rainwater and groundwater, and it has been collected in tanks. However, it takes up space, and it is a threat for workers because of the radiation levels. Although the water has been filtered, some radioactive isotopes were too difficult to remove. Fishermen in the area fear that the government´s decision could turn consumers away from their products.

Video calling is a technology when you call somebody. You see him at the same time. It is a normal thing for us today. People do not know it one hundred years ago. People first get the idea of video calling in the late 1890s . They do not know how to do it. The first success is in the 1930s. But the video is very bad. A US company makes a Television-Phone in 1955. People see each other when they call. The screen is 25 centimeters wide. The Internet changes video calling in the late 1990s. It is fast and the picture is good. Many people use video calling every day. They work from home or they must stay at home. They are happy that they can see their family and friends on the screen.	In the late 1890s, people started to think that it could be possible to see the person who they were calling. It was not easy to develop such technology . In the 1930s, special boots were in post offices, but the video was very bad. In 1955, the US company Kay Lab invented Television-Phone, and they called it ‘the telephone of tomorrow’. The screen was 25 centimeters wide and two people could see each other while calling. Scientists developed much better technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were very expensive. In the late 1990s, it became possible to use the Internet for video calling and people started to use the technology normally. Many people started to use video calling in 2020 because they could not meet each other. Funny moments happened sometimes because people could not use the technology well.	Development of video calling started in the late 19 th century; however, the technology became available to the public in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed in post offices and they were shown at various world expositions. Attempts to use normal telephony networks to transmit video failed mostly due to poor picture quality and the lack of video compression techniques. The 1955 invention of Television-Phone was hailed ´the telephone of tomorrow´ when it was unveiled by San Diego´s Kay Lab. The device gave a 25-centimeter view of the person who somebody was calling, and it lasted until one of the persons hang up. Very expensive systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s; however, only in the late 20 th century with high-speed Internet broadband , video calling became a practical technology for regular use. Video calling has become an important part of life since, especially for people working from home during 2020 and 2021, and there have been many mishaps and funny moments, too, while using the technology.

This news is from Germany. A driver makes a mistake. She does not give way to a vehicle . The vehicle is a tank. It is 62 tonnes heavy. The driver of the tank cannot stop, but he turns the tank. Thanks to this, the driver does not die. She is OK. Only her car is wrecked . The tank was completely fine.	An 18 year-old German driver ignored another vehicle’s  right of way and was so unlucky that the vehicle was a 62-tonne tank. The driver of the tank could not stop it, but he managed to turn it so that the driver of the car was not crushed. The damage on the Toyota was worth around 8,000 pounds.

A kangaroo is born. He is born at a zoo. This zoo is in Russia. In the beginning, the kangaroo is in its mother’s pouch . After a year, it comes out. The kangaroo is a boy. He is an albino. His fur is white. His eyes are red. One kangaroo in a thousand is an albino kangaroo. He is special. The kangaroo is safe in the zoo. However, albino kangaroos in the wild are not safe.	Last year, a baby kangaroo was born at a zoo in Russia. It hid in its mother’s pouch for a long time. Now, it came out for the first time. The young kangaroo is a boy. What’s more, he is an albino kangaroo which means that he has white fur and red eyes. Only one kangaroo in a thousand is an albino. The baby kangaroo is lucky to be in a zoo – albino kangaroos attract more predators in the wild. They are also more susceptible to skin cancer, sunburn, and sight and hearing difficulties.	A baby albino kangaroos has come out if its mother’s pouch for the first time at a Russian zoo, captivating visitors. The baby born last year made its debut appearance after a year of hiding and officials were able to confirm the joey is, in fact, a boy. “He first started showing from the pouch in March. Before this, we only had an idea that there could be a baby kangaroo in the pouch. Then we saw that the baby kangaroo had light fur . He was pink with red eyes, and we understood that we had an albino kangaroo, one in a thousand.” The white marsupial wouldn’t stand much chance of survival in the wild, but he’ll be safe in his shady closure in the zoo. Albino kangaroos are often more at risk than their dark brown counterparts, as they stand out, attracting more predators. They’re also more susceptible to skin cancer and sunburn and more likely to have sight and hearing difficulties. But it seems this young roo and his mother are getting along just fine together. “The mother and son are living well. They’re getting on without the father. The mother is resting after pregnancy. It is very likely that she is pregnant with her second baby kangaroo, but this is not yet confirmed.”
Shanti is an elephant. She paints pictures. One picture costs 2000 dollars. Some people pay the 2000 dollars for one picture. Shanti painted 12 pictures but now she stops. The director of the Prague gallery knows why she stops. The director says, “Shanti was in a film. She is a star . Now she has depression . When the depression stops, she will paint again.” Shanti does a good thing. The money from pictures helps elephants in Sri Lanka.	Shanti is an elephant and her paintings cost 2000 dollars. Somebody has actually paid 2000 dollars for a painting done by an elephant. Shanti has painted 12 paintings so far but now she is refusing to paint more. The director of the Prague gallery came up with an entirely  improbable reason why. The director said that “she starred as an elephant named Bimbo in the movie. She is an artist. Now she is in some sort of depression. We will just have to wait for her next wave of creativity.” There is a good reason for all of this. Shanti’s paintings bring money which helps elephants in Sri Lanka.	Shanti the elephant’s paintings fetched 2000 dollars apiece . Yes, that is right. Somebody paid 2000 dollars for a painting done by an elephant. Shanti’s was on a creative streak  knocking out 12 paintings, but now she is refusing to put brush to canvas . The curator of a Prague gallery came up with an entirely improbable reason why. The director said that “she starred as an elephant named Bimbo in the movie “Alarm in the Sky,” which is important because if the career of an actor or a singer reaches a certain point, they may stop making art. So, now if the artist is in some sort of depression, we will just have to wait for her next wave of creativity. She is an elephant.“ Still there is good cause for all of this. Shanti’s paintings raise money for an elephant sanctuary in Sri Lanka. So, let’s hope that she gets the brush and trunk again, and someone forks out a pile of cash to get an elephant in the room .
The Nazca Desert is in Peru. Nazca lines are there. Nazca lines are very famous. They are lines in the ground. They make large animals and other things. They are so big that people cannot see them from the ground. People can see them only from above. Archaeologists find new lines. The lines make a cat. The cat is 37 meters long. It is on a rocky hill. Archaeologists do not explore this place before. They are surprised to find the cat. The rain and wind take away rocks and soil from the hill. That is why archaeologists do not find the cat before.	Nazca in Peru is home to famous Nazca lines that are more than 2,000 years old. Nazca lines are very large geoglyphs that people made in the soil of the Nazca Desert. Archaeologists found a 37-meter-long cat that was on a rocky hill in an area that they did not explore very much in the past. People made lines that were 30 to 40 centimeters wide to outline the cat, and they used rocks to make the eyes and mouth. There was strong erosion on the hill, which means that rain and wind took away rocks and soil. This was the reason why archaeologists did not find the cat earlier.	Peruvian archaeologists have uncovered a 37-meter-long cat etching in a little explored area of the country´s celebrated Nazca Lines UNESCO heritage site. The site is home to hundreds of gigantic geoglyphs that date back more than 2,000 years. The geoglyph was drawn on the side of a fairly rocky hill on the Nazca plain, and it was made by forming lines or furrows of 30 to 40 centimeters wide which outlined the figure. Some parts, such as the eyes and mouth, were formed by piling up rocks. The figure was in the process of disappearing because erosion had been very strong on the hill, and this allowed it to remain hidden for many years.

Soon, the media wrote about Komuro´s mother and her debt . There were reports that she got 35,000 dollars from her fiancé, and she used some of the money to pay Komuro´s college. Komuro said that the money was a gift, but the scandal was very unpleasant for the royal family. The couple waited to have the wedding, and Komuro left to study in the US. Last week, Komuro returned, and the couple announced the date of their wedding. After the wedding, Princess Mako will leave the royal family, which is a custom in Japan.	Authorities in Japan said that Princess Mako will marry her former college classmate on October 26, following years of intense scrutiny and criticism that put their engagement in an unflattering light. The 29-year-old niece of Emperor Naruhito was engaged to Kei Komuro in 2017. The couple initially captivated the public; however, media reports soon talked about a financial dispute over a 35,000-dollar debt that Komuro´s mother allegedly received from her former fiancé, some of which went towards paying Komuro´s college fees. Komuro said that the money was given as a gift; however, the regular media started to pay attention to the royal family scandal, too. In 2018, the marriage was postponed, and Komuro left to attend a law school in the US. He returned only last week, with a ponytail that set off discussion about whether he was being disrespectful. Princess Mako will leave the royal family upon her marriage as is custom, and she will become a commoner . None of the ceremonies that usually happen with a royal marriage will take place.

The two countries have been fighting over the Kashmir region since the late 1940s.

Pink is a new colour of chocolate. Supposedly , it comes from a new type of cocoa . Some people do not like this. One person says that the pink chocolate will cost a lot. Businesses will sell it for a lot. He says that they will sell it to rich people who enjoy food. Another person says that all cocoa beans turn into dark chocolate.

The Games will feature participants from 36 nations and will involve 19 events, including badminton, basketball, chess and volleyball. “I know our athletes are excited to be here. We have 205 athletes from the United States competing in all sports. And we have 20 different sports here at the European games. Berlin is an amazing city. I can honestly say that it’s not what I thought.” Germany, home to the world’s fast-growing Jewish population, is full of pride that the country responsible for the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were killed will host the 10-day “Jewish Olympics”. “I want to encourage you for the question if it is right to come to Berlin for the Maccabi. There is only one answer – yes!
